D.\n\nThis paper describes a new improved system of spatial vectorcardiography that is practical for clinical use. It represents an optimum compromise among such factors as soundness of theoretic basis, accuracy, reproducibility, signal-to-noise ratio, and speed of application. Some of its advantages over currently employed systems include a rational physical basis, corrections for torso shape, avoidance of left arm, insensitivity to individual variability of ventricle location, and accuracy comparable to applicability of 3-dimensional torso-model data to the human subject.

A fundamental advantage of this system is revealed when data for a variety of different dipole locations are applied. Indeed, the system has been deliberately devised to be relatively insensitive to dipole location and, as such, surmounts a major defect of most systems. To illustrate, consider the influence on V. of shifting the dipole to location 04, which is 2 cm. forward and 2 cm. rightward of the design-center location 22, a total shift of 2.8 cm. Electrode A, C, and I potentials are then given by12 VA = 71 PX 68 Pz VC = 161 p-57p, V, = -74p,, + 43p which differ considerably from those in Equation (1). Yet the V. expression of Equation (2) still yields a faithful result: V. = 129 px - 1.9pz . The relative amplitude has been reduced by about 5 per cent from 136, and the angle error is tan-' (1.9/129) = 0.80. In similar fashion, dependence on dipole location can be calculated for the other potential differences and V,. For dipole locations within a cube V, 4 cm. on a side that is centered on location 22, it is found that image vectors associated with VX, y ., and V, undergo length changes of about \u00b19 per cent and angle shifts of \u00b120. For a cube 5 cm. on a side, length variations are \u00b120 per cent and angle shifts are \u00b1t50. The latter volume was found to encompass 90 per cent of 40 patients with assorted heart disease whose ventricle centers were determined precisely by experiments Thus, deviations owing to individual location of dipole are usually comparable to the accuracy with which model data apply to the human subject. Deterioration in accuracy with commonly used systems of vectorcardiography when dipole location is shifted is very substantial in the range for which this system shows good performance. Although this system does tend to become less accurate outside the specified range. It is of course tacitly assumed in these calculations that the transverse level at which electrodes A, C, E, I, and ill are located on the subject is not seriously in error.

Electrode Attachment. It has been found most convenient to use a standard perforated rubber belt to hold the 5 chest electrodes. Commercially available precordial electrodes may be inserted under the belt at locations A, C, and I. Modified precordial electrodes with a straight rod perpendicular to the disk slide through an appropriate hole in the belt for locations E and M. The rod is long enough so that spacers can be slipped onto the rod and under the belt to hold electrodes firmly against the skin despite hollows in body contour frequently encountered. Electrode H consists of a flat precordial type electrode disk; it is affixed with adhesive tape. As is true in all systems, a ground electrode is required. This may be attached to any of the 3 unused limbs, such as the right leg. 2. Female Subjects. In female subjects, electrode C has some unavoidable error when the transverse level of the ventricles does not fall above or below the left breast. This error is not acute because electrode C serves as a correction for 1\u00be , is weighted by about 27 per cent in its contribution to the three resistor junction of V., and does not affect V, at all. 3. Subject Posture. Because amplitudes of potential differences V., Va, ,and V. are larger than those obtained in presently used systems of vectorcardiography, it has been possible\n\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on April 9, 2024\n---\n744 SYSTEM FOR SPATIAL VECTORCARDIOGRAPHY to study subjects of all ages in the sitting position with little disturbance from muscle tremor. (instead of 7.15 R) and a shunt of value 1.86 (6.31 R) = 11.8 R is needed across V, (instead of 13.3 R).\n\n4. Skin Treatment. The network of resistors (fig. 1) may be connected directly to the subject, but it is necessary to rub the skin, so that resistance beneath the electrode is small compared with the input resistance to the network. Otherwise electrical errors are encountered. This problem is similar to the skin resistance problem recognized in connection with the Wilson central terminal, and is present in any system that employs resistance networks. Hence, the choice of R (which sets the entire impedance level of the networks) is important. The value of R should be as high as is consistent with 60 cps. disturbances, desirably 100,000 ohms and not less than 25,000 ohms. The skin should be rubbed under each electrode until a resistance less than R/10 is achieved between any two electrodes (this may be measured roughly by using a common ohmmeter). If R = 50,000 ohms, the R/10 result (5000 ohms) is easily achieved with moderate rubbing which typically gives 3000-ohms resistance. If R is too small, extremely brisk rubbing is required, which is quite inconvenient, time-consuming and uncomfortable.\n\n5. Vectorcardiograph Input Resistance. The input grid resistors (if any) of the amplifiers to which Vx, V, ,and V, are delivered must be taken into account if standardization factors are to be precisely equalized. Figure 1 portrays conditions for an infinite input resistance, often approached in practice. If amplifier input resistances are each equal to KR, where K is any constant, then the shunt resistance required across V- is given by 7.15 KR/(K + 2). The shunt required for V, is 1.86 times this value. For example, suppose the amplifier input resistance is 15 times R.

Although the correct level is usually found within 1 inch of the fifth interspace, there are sometimes individual exceptions. Moreover, for precise research measurements it is desirable to be as certain as possible that the level selected for the chest electrodes is correct.\n\nA novel three-step technic utilizing a triple-electrode assembly may be used to determine this level precisely in a rapid manner. The basis of the method resides in a property of the image surface in the region corresponding to the precordium. Over this region the outward bulge of the image surface is very pronounced because of the leftward and forward anatomic location of most human hearts.8 The level at which this bulge is greatest corresponds to the desired electrical level and, in a torso model, is the level at which the internal dipole is located.\"2 The objective of the method is to determine the level of maximum bulge in image space.\n\nThe electrode assembly, shown in figure 6, is utilized in the 3-step procedure belown In all cases the electrodes are always aligned with the intersection on the precordium of a plane containing the vertical central anatomic axis of the subject.\n\nStep a. Place electrode 2 directly over the heart at the level of the fifth interspace with electrode 1\n---\nSYSTEM FOR SPATIAL VECTORCARDIOGRAPHY\n\nThis procedure was developed on a sound theoretic basis in terms of properties of dipole potentials in 3-dimensional torso models. Space does not permit a description of the underlying theory.\n\nSeveral practical points deserve mention. The person holding the insulated handle of the electrode assembly should be connected to ground by means of a leg electrode to minimize 60 cps interference, if it is encountered. Before electrodes are applied, rub the skin along the line of the electrodes a total distance of 4 inches symmetrically about the initial level. The electrode line on the body should be wiped clean before each trial, and contiguity of electrode paste must be avoided. If complexes are too small in amplitude, the electrode line along which the determination is made may be shifted toward the midline or toward the left side. Because the method is extremely sensitive in most subjects, a small error in initial level results in a pronounced disagreement in step c. Therefore, waveform agreement in the 3 steps need not be perfect to obtain good accuracy. Three trials are usually the maximum number required to arrive at a final result, once the technic is not exactly vertical (see text). Electrodes are inch diameter disks spaced exactly 1 inch apart. A ground electrode is affixed to the subject's right leg. The function of the 50,000-ohm (50 K) resistor is to equalize resistance levels as seen from the electrocardiograph.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nActive interest shown to Dr. G. E.

Preamble\n\nThe granting of clinical staff privileges to physicians is a primary mechanism used by institutions to uphold the quality of care. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations requires that the granting of continuing medical staff privileges be based on assessments of applicants against professional criteria specified in the medical staff bylaws. Physicians themselves are thus charged with identifying the criteria that constitute professional competence and with evaluating their peers accordingly. Yet, the process of evaluating physicians\u2019 knowledge and competence is often constrained by the evaluator\u2019s own knowledge and ability to elicit the appropriate information, problems compounded by the growing number of highly specialized procedures for which privileges are requested.\n\nThe American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/American College of Physicians\u2013American Society of Internal Medicine (ACC/AHA/ACP\u2013ASIM) Task Force on Clinical Competence was formed in 1998 to develop recommendations for attaining and maintaining the cognitive and technical skills necessary for the competent performance of a specific cardiovascular service, procedure, or technology. These documents are evidence-based, and when evidence is not available, expert opinion is utilized to formulate recommendations. Indications and contraindications for specific services or procedures are not included in the scope of these documents. Recommendations are intended to assist those who must judge the competence of cardiovascular health care providers entering practice for the first time and/or those who are in practice and undergo periodic review of their practice expertise. The assessment of competence is complex and multidimensional; therefore, isolated recommendations contained herein may not necessarily be sufficient or appropriate for judging overall competence.\n\nThe ACC/AHA/ACP\u2013ASIM Task Force makes every effort to avoid any actual or potential conflicts of interest that might arise as a result of an outside relationship or personal.\n\nThis document was approved by the American College of Cardiology Board of Trustees in November 2001 and the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee in August 2001.\n\nWhen citing this document, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association would appreciate the following citation format: Kadish AH, Buxton AE, Kennedy HL, Knight BP, Mason JW, Schuger CD, Tracy CM.

Background Introduced in 1902 by Einthoven, electrocardiography is the graphical display of electrical potential differences of an electric field originating in the heart as recorded at the body surface. 1 As a record of electrical activity of the heart, it is a unique technology that provides information not readily obtained by other methods. In fact, recording of the resting 12-lead ECG continues to be the most commonly used laboratory procedure for the diagnosis of heart disease. The procedure is safe, simple, and reproducible; the record lends itself to serial studies; and the relative cost is minimal. The development of portable devices to record ECGs led to the development of AECG recordings and expanded the use of this technique to the diagnosis of transient arrhythmias, providing crucial information at the time that symptoms occur. An AECG can be obtained via continuous recorders (Holter monitors) or with intermittent recorders (also known as event monitors or loop recorders) and is used for patients with infrequent symptoms, in whom a clinical correlation is needed.", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 5022, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55bec073-f469-472c-8cb3-280886b3c615": {"__data__": {"id_": "55bec073-f469-472c-8cb3-280886b3c615", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_name": "Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 70811, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a43fddb0-f7df-434f-b7b7-0ccf1d96014d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_name": "Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 70811, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "02c0b89b5dcf13bf9e4298f2c285d083b1f61f9c156c4db05d27555e846fed3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aea0c455-2c2a-47f4-b213-d9d18505e317", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_name": "Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 70811, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "42a2de55db722d4be96601367f4b0a2010a970dcfeb6e497c530c80447ff87fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ddacc625-ff02-4aec-9de6-b5b60cf7d6b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_name": "Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 70811, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "ffd579332dcd308e98e3fbbcd92b9dff034393b6beca3a615c07d5e5c99b40c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1 As a record of electrical activity of the heart, it is a unique technology that provides information not readily obtained by other methods.

Introduction\n\nA. Organization of Committee and Evidence Review This document is a revision of the 1995 ACP/ACC/AHA Clinical Competence Statement in Electrocardiography. The Writing Committee consisted of acknowledged experts in electrocardiography representing the ACC (five members), and the AHA (two members). Both the academic and private practice sectors were represented. The document was reviewed by three official reviewers nominated by the ACC, three official reviewers nominated by the AHA, the ACC Clinical Electrophysiology Committee, the Electrocardiography and Arrhythmias Committee of the Council on Clinical Cardiology, and 16 content reviewers nominated by the Writing Committee. On August 31, 2001, the document was approved for publication by the ACC Board of Trustees and the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee.\n\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on April 9, 2024This document will be considered current unless the Task Force revises or withdraws it from distribution. In addition, the governing board of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology has formally endorsed this document.\n\n III. Twelve-Lead ECGs\n\nA. Overview and Indications for the Procedure There are numerous potential clinical uses of the 12-lead ECG. The ECG may reflect changes associated with primary or secondary myocardial processes (e.g., those associated with coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, or infiltrative disorders), metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities, and therapeutic or toxic effects of drugs or devices. Electrocardiography serves as the gold standard for the noninvasive diagnosis of arrhythmias and conduction disturbances, and it occasionally is the only marker for the presence of heart disease. 6\n\nAs is the case with any other laboratory procedure, appropriate and accurate use of the ECG requires that its sensitivity and specificity be understood and considered in the interpretation of the recording. This is somewhat more complex for ECGs than for many other laboratory tests because ECGs are composed of a number of waveforms, each with its own sensitivity and specificity and each influenced differently by a variety of pathologic and pathophysiologic factors.\n\nIn the diagnosis of arrhythmias and conduction disturbances, sensitivity and specificity of ECGs are far higher than\n---\n Kadish et al ACC/AHA Competence Statement\n\nin the diagnosis of structural and/or metabolic abnormalities. by reviewing previous tracings. Some examples are listed in Table 3.\n\n C. Technical Aspects of ECG Recording and Interpretation\n\nAccurate electrocardiographic interpretation assumes that technical standards are adhered to during the acquisition and recording of tracings. A number of technical factors may alter the quality of recorded ECGs. Some of these are patient-related, some are operator-dependent, and others relate to the equipment utilized for recording. Errors or variances in technical practice must be recognized by the physician if tracings are to be interpreted appropriately.\n\nPatient-related technical factors include muscle tremors and movement that may impair the quality of recordings. Failure to minimize and recognize artifacts while recording, and failure to recognize artifacts during interpretation, may result in an incorrect diagnosis of arrhythmias and may lead to unnecessary interventions and treatment.", "start_char_idx": 4135, "end_char_idx": 9122, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddacc625-ff02-4aec-9de6-b5b60cf7d6b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddacc625-ff02-4aec-9de6-b5b60cf7d6b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_name": "Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 70811, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a43fddb0-f7df-434f-b7b7-0ccf1d96014d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_name": "Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 70811, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "02c0b89b5dcf13bf9e4298f2c285d083b1f61f9c156c4db05d27555e846fed3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "55bec073-f469-472c-8cb3-280886b3c615", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_name": "Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 70811, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "5735c59f866c863b15694f4617e2331f1c1924063496934fe425268298123241", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_a43fddb0-f7df-434f-b7b7-0ccf1d96014d_24_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Name\nType: string\nSummary: Names of individuals in the table\n\nColumn: Title\nType: string\nSummary: Professional titles of the individuals", "file_path": "/content/data/Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_name": "Clinical Competence Statement on Electrocardiography and Ambulatory Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 70811, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "ec60529911cbf2412d42f953b69bd8cd7e3f9001438f4d7d98804cc016d27be8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "by reviewing previous tracings.

Variations in body habitus (e.g., marked obesity, presence of chronic lung disease) may influence an ECG and should be noted at the time of recording.\n\nOperators recording ECGs should ensure that chest leads are placed in the proper position and electrodes make good skin contact to minimize artifacts. Incorrect placement of precordial leads may lead to a false diagnosis of infarction. The reversal of limb leads and the switching of precordial leads have been well-documented to cause alterations in ECGs. The presence of dextrocardia must be ascertained at the time of recording in order to correctly revise lead placement. Care must be taken to avoid using excess paste with electrode systems that require conductive skin paste. Excess paste may create \"common\" electrodes and contribute to errors in recording precordial leads.\n\nCalibration marks or clear notations should be inscribed on each ECG tracing to enable interpreter to determine the paper speed and gain settings used in recording. Standard settings of 25 mm per s and 10 mm per mV should be used unless otherwise indicated on the tracing. Because of the possibility of electrical hazards resulting from current leakage in the recording apparatus, equipment must be checked at regular intervals to ensure that standards for current leakage are met.\n\nThe ultimate responsibility for making a correct interpretation of an ECG lies with the interpreting physician. Thus, it is incumbent upon the physician to be able to recognize aberrations and artifacts resulting from the above technical variations.\n\n D. Computer Interpretation of ECGs\n\nSeveral studies have examined the accuracy of computer ECG interpretation programs and have suggested that computer analysis cannot substitute for physician interpretation of ECGs. A systematic study of computerized ECG interpretation performed in 1991 demonstrated that computer programs were 6.6% less accurate, on average, than cardiologists at identifying ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial infarction (MI).

However, disturbances in rhythm were not evaluated in that investigation, and anecdotal experience suggests that computer interpretation has a higher rate of error in analysis of rhythm than it does in the diagnosis of MI and hypertrophy. A more recent Japanese study 21 compared what has generally been the best-performing automated ECG interpretation program with readings by 25 physicians in their first two years of training and three cardiologists. Although the computer interpretation was usually accurate in diagnosing axis deviation and sinus tachycardia or bradycardia, it performed far less well than physicians-in-training in evaluating bundle branch block and QT interval. Overall, the false-positive and false-negative rate was 18 times higher for computer interpretations than for physicians-in-training in major ECG diagnoses. In addition to the lower accuracy of computer interpretation programs, comparison with prior ECG tracings, which is an important element in the interpretation of ECGs, is not a feature of current-generation computerized interpretation systems. Thus, it is mandatory that all computer-interpreted ECGs be verified and appropriately corrected by an experienced electrocardiographer.\n\nExamples of Diagnoses Aided by Review of Previous Electrocardiograms\n1.

Training in the use of ECGs, including supervised reading of ECGs, is an essential requirement of a cardiology fellowship program, as described in the COCATS requirements. Board certification in cardiology requires passing a separate portion of the board certification examination in cardiology that deals only with ECG interpretation. Thus, those individuals that are board-certified in cardiology have demonstrated their competence in a standardized examination. Some physicians who are not board-certified in cardiology are experienced electrocardiographers and are appropriately credentialed to read ECGs. Documentation of having interpreted 500 ECGs during or after training under the supervision of an expert electrocardiographer may be an alternate way to demonstrate competence. However, as valid, reliable, and widely available standardized ECG exams (such as the ABIM ICE ECG exam) become more widely accepted, we recommend that by 2005 they become the primary pathway, apart from cardiology board-certification, to demonstrate competence when granting initial ECG overreading privileges to physicians not previously credentialed. This is especially true if a physician is serving as the interpreter of in-hospital ECGs of patients whose clinical status is unfamiliar to that physician.\n\n Maintaining Competence in the Interpretation of 12-Lead ECGs\n\nMaintaining competence in the interpretation of 12-lead ECGs also requires ongoing practice. If interpretations are made only occasionally, arrhythmia may be missed or inappropriately diagnosed, particularly when there is a change in the recording system, analysis system, or technical personnel in the laboratory performing the ECG. This Task Force recommends a minimum of 100 interpretations a year to maintain competence. A study validating this would be welcome.\n\nIn addition, electrocardiographers should periodically assess their reading skills. Though electrocardiography is the most static of the cardiological technologies, knowledge of the significance, sensitivity, specificity, and frequency of both old and newly recognized electrocardiographic patterns is continuously evolving. Examples from the past decade include Brugada Syndrome, the use of right chest leads to diagnose right ventricular infarction, recognition of new infarct patterns, particularly those indicative of proximal left anterior descending occlusion, and of infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block, and the realization that Q-waves do not necessarily indicate irreversible MI. Because electrocardiographic interpretation is often done without knowledge of the patient\u2019s clinical status or subsequent follow-up, electrocardiographers do not often receive feedback that enables them to correct errors and improve. Thus, periodic self-assessment and retraining in electrocardiography are necessary. Numerous resources are available for self-assessment and continuing education in electrocardiography. These may include ACC electrocardiography self-assessment programs, electrocardiography workshops at the ACP\u2013ASIM annual session, sessions provided by other national and international organizations, and other seminars and case conferences approved for continuing medical education credit. Clinicians credentialed to interpret ECGs should routinely participate in quality improvement activities such as having a number of ECGs over-read by colleagues and participating in periodic discussions of systemic issues involving ECG acquisition and interpretation. Ideally, these activities should result in procedural changes and improvements in skills, patient care, and patient outcomes.\n\n AECG Monitoring\n\n Overview and Indications for the Procedure\n\nAmbulatory electrocardiography is used in clinical practice to detect, document, and characterize occurrences of abnormal cardiac electrical behavior of the heart during ordinary daily activities. Because certain abnormalities may occur only during sleep or with mental, emotional, or exercise-induced changes in cardiac oxygenation or function, an ECG may need to be recorded over long periods of time. There are two categories of AECG examination: continuous recordings (typically used for 24 to 48 h) and intermittent recordings that may be made over long periods of time to provide brief.\n---\n TABLE 6.

Recording signal processing pat compresses or filters pe data, altering pe ST-segment characteristics\n\n Minimum Training Necessary for Competence in Interpreting AECGs\n\nPrerequisite to minimal competence in ambulatory electrocardiography is competence in interpreting standard 12-lead ECGs. These recommendations address the special educational and cognitive skills needed to assess heart rate variability, cardiac pacemakers, and ICDs by ambulatory electrocardiography. Training should result in the cognitive skills needed to interpret AECGs, as listed in Table 6. In addition, depending on the AECG instrumentation utilized, a variety of factors can result in false-positive or false-negative findings in assessing cardiac arrhythmias (Table 7) or myocardial ischemia (Table 8). Knowledge of these artifactual or transient physiological changes is incumbent upon physicians rendering interpretations of AECGs.\n\n Minimum Knowledge Necessary for Competence in Interpreting AECGs\n\nAmbulatory electrocardiography is a subdivision of clinical electrocardiography, and for this reason, the criteria for competence are frequently the same as those for classic electrocardiography. The electrocardiographic diagnoses listed in Table 1, that can be diagnosed using AECGs, include items 4 through 39, 41 through 44, 47 through 49, 51 through 60, and 79 through 88. There are, however, technical and cognitive aspects peculiar to AECGs that require additional knowledge (Table 6).\n\nBecause of the many differences in recording, analysis, and reporting systems, this document can address only the features common to all ambulatory electrocardiographic systems. However, it is important that physicians who make interpretations understand the equipment and techniques used to perform AECGs and are familiar with the specific system used in their own laboratories. Physicians are rarely involved in the data collection and processing phases of AECGs. However, physician over-reading is essential. Regardless of the processing method, physicians should be aware of the potential for false-positive or false-negative findings in arrhythmia detection and classification (Table 7) and in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia (Table 8).\n\n Technical Aspects of Interpreting AECGs\n\nAmbulatory electrocardiography has the potential for producing a substantial amount of invalid data because of technical problems inherent in the recording and analytic processes. The ambulatory state is not stable in most cases. Noise interference from numerous sources that may occur over a 24-h recording period is a major cause for computer inaccuracies in both arrhythmia and ST-segment shift recognition and analysis. Many of the potential sources of error in the computer analysis systems are quite complex, and expertise in the technical aspects of AECGs requires an understanding not only of computer algorithms for the detection of QRS complexes and their classification but also of the problems associated with editing the computer analysis results. Physicians who interpret AECGs should have the knowledge base to assess all potential technical failings. Consequently, systems with full disclosure capabilities are preferred by many clinicians because they can \"read\" the tracing much as they read a 12-lead ECG. The standard 12-lead ECG has also proved to have adjunctive value in the interpretation of AECGs.\n---\n Kadish et al ACC/AHA Competence Statement\n\nE. Maintaining Competence in the Interpretation of AECGs\n\nMaintaining competence in ambulatory electrocardiography requires a continual updating of technological knowledge and an ongoing accrual of experience in the interpretation of AECGs. If interpretations are made only occasionally, arrhythmia may be missed or inappropriately diagnosed, particularly when there is a change in the recording system, analysis system, or technical personnel in the laboratory performing the AECG. This Task Force recommends a minimum of 25 interpretations a year to maintain competence.\n\nCurrently, there are no formal data to document a correlation between the frequency of AECG interpretation and practitioner competence. Continuing competence as a part of quality assurance programs may be assessed by reviewing a random sample of AECG interpretations performed by the physician requesting continuing privileges. This sample should be examined by an acknowledged expert in ambulatory electrocardiography or one who is currently training physicians in the interpretation of AECGs. If no one within an individual institution is qualified to review a candidate\u2019s experience and cognitive skills, a qualified outside expert should be consulted.\n\n References\n\n1. Eipoven W.

Fletcher, MD, Chair; Gary J. Balady, MD, Vice Chair; Ezra A. Amsterdam, MD; Bernard Chaitman, MD; Robert Eckel, MD; Jerome Fleg, MD; Victor F. Froelicher, MD; Arthur S. Leon, MD; Ileana L. Pin\u02dca, MD; Roxanne Rodney, MD; Denise G. Simons-Morton, MD, PhD; Mark A. Williams, PhD; Terry Bazzarre, PhD\n\nThe purpose of this report is to provide revised standards and guidelines for the exercise testing and training of individuals who are free from clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease and those with known cardiovascular disease. These guidelines are intended for physicians, nurses, exercise physiologists, specialists, technologists, and other healthcare professionals involved in exercise testing and training of these populations. This report is in accord with the \"Statement on Exercise\" published by the American Heart Association (AHA).\n\nThese guidelines are a revision of the 1995 standards of the AHA that addressed the issues of exercise testing and training. An update of background, scientific rationale, and selected references is provided, and current issues of practical importance in the clinical use of these standards are considered. These guidelines are in accord with the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/AHA Guidelines for Exercise Testing.\n\n Exercise Testing\n\nThe Cardiovascular Response to Exercise\n\nExercise, a common physiological stress, can elicit cardiovascular abnormalities that are not present at rest, and it can be used to determine the adequacy of cardiac function. Because exercise is only one of many stresses to which humans can be exposed, it is more appropriate to call an exercise test exactly that and not a \"stress test.\" This is particularly relevant considering the increased use of nonexercise stress tests.\n\n Types of Exercise\n\nThree types of muscular contraction or exercise can be applied as a stress to the cardiovascular system: isometric (static), isotonic (dynamic or locomotory), and resistance (a combination of isometric and isotonic). Isotonic exercise, which is defined as a muscular contraction resulting in movement, primarily provides a volume load to the left ventricle, and the response is proportional to the size of the working muscle mass and the intensity of exercise. Isometric exercise is defined as a muscular contraction without movement (eg, handgrip) and imposes greater pressure than volume load on the left ventricle in relation to the body's ability to supply oxygen. Cardiac output is not increased as much as in isotonic exercise because increased resistance in active muscle groups limits blood flow. Resistance exercise combines both isometric and isotonic exercise (such as free weight lifting).\n\n Exercise Physiology\n\nIn the early phases of exercise in the upright position, cardiac output is increased by an augmentation in stroke volume mediated through the use of the Frank-Starling mechanism and heart rate; the increase in cardiac output in the latter phases of exercise is primarily due to an increase in heart rate. At fixed submaximal workloads below ventilatory threshold in healthy persons, steady-state conditions are usually reached within minutes after the onset of exercise; after this occurs, heart rate, cardiac output, blood pressure, and pulmonary ventilation are maintained at reasonably constant levels. During strenuous exertion, sympathetic discharge is maximal and parasympathetic stimulation is withdrawn, resulting in vasoconstriction in most circulatory body systems, except for that in exercising muscle and in the cerebral and coronary circulations. As exercise progresses, skeletal muscle blood flow is increased, oxygen extraction increases as much as 3-fold, total calculated peripheral resistance decreases, and\n---\n Fletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 1695\n\nsystolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure usually increase.

During staged exercise testing, oxygen uptake usually remains relatively stable (steady state) after the second minute of each intensity of exercise below the ventilatory threshold.

It is considered the best measure of cardiovascular fitness and exercise capacity. VO2 max represents the amount of oxygen transported and used in cellular metabolism. It is convenient to express oxygen uptake in multiples of sitting/resting requirements. One metabolic equivalent (MET) is a unit of sitting/resting oxygen uptake (3.5 mL of O2 per kilogram of body weight per minute [mL \u00b7 kg \u00b7 min]).

It is difficult to accurately predict VO2 max from its relation to exercise habits and age because of considerable scatter and correlations that are generally low. Table 1 depicts normal values for age. The nomogram shown in Figure 1 expresses the concept of maximal METs predicted from peak treadmill workload by reflecting it in terms of that expected for age in men, with 100% being normal.\n\nVO2 max is equal to the product of maximum cardiac output and maximum arteriovenous oxygen difference. Because cardiac output is equal to the product of stroke volume and heart rate and because stroke volume only increases to a certain level, VO2 is directly related to heart rate. The maximum arteriovenous VO2 difference (which increases with exercise) during exercise has a physiological limit of 15% to 17% volume; hence, if maximum effort is achieved, VO2 max can be used to estimate maximum cardiac output.\n\nMyocardial Oxygen Uptake\n\nMyocardial oxygen uptake is primarily determined by intramyocardial wall stress (ie, the product of left ventricular [LV] pressure and volume, divided by LV wall thickness), contractility, and heart rate. Other, less important factors include external work performed by the heart, the energy necessary for activation, and the basal metabolism of the myocardium.\n\nAge\n\nMaximum values of VO2 max occur between the ages of 15 and 30 years and decrease progressively with age. At 60 years, mean VO2 max in men is approximately two-thirds of that at 20 years. The decline in VO2 max averages 8% to 10% per decade in both sedentary and athletic populations.\n\nSex\n\nA lower VO2 max in women is attributed to their smaller muscle mass, lower hemoglobin and blood volume, and smaller stroke volume compared with men.\n\nExercise Habits\n\nPhysical activity has an important influence on VO2 max. After 3 weeks of bed rest, there is a 25% decrease in VO2 max in healthy men. In moderately active young men, VO2 max is '12 METs, whereas individuals performing aerobic training such as distance running can have a VO2 max as high as 18 to 24 METs (60 to 85 mL \u00b7 kg 21 \u00b7 min 21).\n---\n1696 Circulation October 2, 2001\n\nphysical conditions, state of health, blood volume, sinus node function, medications, and environment. Arterial Blood Pressure Response Systolic blood pressure rises with increasing dynamic work as a result of increasing cardiac output, whereas diastolic pressure usually remains about the same or moderately lower, and it may be heard to zero in some normal subjects. Normal values of maximum systolic blood pressure for men have been defined and are directly related to age. After maximum exercise, there is usually a decline in systolic blood pressure, which normally reaches resting levels within 6 minutes and often remains lower than pre-exercise levels for several hours. When exercise is terminated abruptly, some healthy persons have precipitous drops in systolic blood pressure due to venous pooling and a delayed immediate postexercise increase in systemic vascular resistance to match the reduction in cardiac output. Figure 2 shows the physiological response to submaximal and maximum treadmill exercise on the basis of tests of 700 apparently healthy men aged 25 to 54 years. Maximum rate-pressure product (heart rate x systolic blood pressure) ranges from a tenth percentile value of 25,000 to a 90th percentile value of 40,000.\n\nFigure 1.

Heart rate will reach a steady state wipin minutes during low levels of exercise and at a constant work rate.

Oper factors pat influence heart rate include body position, type of dynamic exercise, certain factors.\n\nTesting Procedures Subject Preparation Preparations for exercise testing include the following. \u25cf The subject should be instructed not to eat or smoke for 3 hours before the test. Water may be taken as needed at any time. Subjects should dress appropriately for exercise, especially with regard to footwear. No unusual physical efforts should be performed for at least 12 hours before testing. \u25cf When exercise testing is performed for diagnostic purposes, withdrawal of medications may be considered because some drugs (especially b-blockers) attenuate the exercise responses and limit the test interpretation. There are no formal guidelines for tapering medications, but rebound phenomena may occur with abrupt discontinuation of b-blockers in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome. However, most subjects are tested while taking their usual medications. Specific questioning is important to determine which drugs have been taken so that the physician can be aware of possible electrolyte abnormalities and hemodynamic effects of cardioactive drugs. \u25cf A brief history and physical examination should be performed to rule out contraindications (Table 2) to testing or to detect important clinical signs such as a cardiac murmur, gallop sounds, pulmonary \u201cwheezing,\u201d or rales. Subjects with a history of worsening unstable angina or decompensated heart failure should not undergo exercise testing until their condition stabilizes. A cardiac physical examination should indicate which subjects have valvular or congenital heart disease. Because hemodynamic responses to exercise may be abnormal in such subjects, such subjects always warrant careful monitoring and, at times, may require early termination of testing.

Removal of the superficial layer of skin significantly lowers its resistance, thus decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio. The areas for electrode application are first shaved and then rubbed with alcohol-saturated gauze. After the skin dries, it is marked with a felt-tipped pen and rubbed with a fine sandpaper or rough material. With these procedures, skin resistance should be reduced to 5000 V or less.\n\nElectrodes and Cables\n\nMany electrodes are available for performing exercise testing. Silver plate or silver chloride crystal pellets are preferred because they have the lowest offset voltage. Care should be taken to assure that the electrode gel is moist.\n---\n 1698 Circulation October 2, 2001\n\nFigure 3. Placement of 12-lead ECG electrodes.

The physician must compare the raw analog data with computer-generated output to validate its accuracy. Computer processing is not completely reliable because of software limitations in handling noise and inadequacy of the available algorithms.\n\nEquipment and Protocols\n\nFor details regarding exercise testing equipment and exercise testing laboratories, the reader should refer to the AHA\u2019s \u201cGuidelines for Clinical Exercise Testing Laboratories.\u201d\n\nFigure 4 illustrates the relation of METs to stages in the various testing protocols. The treadmill and cycle ergometer are now the most commonly used dynamic exercise testing devices.\n\nCycle\n\nElectrically braked cycles vary the resistance to the pedaling speed (rate-independent ergometers), thereby permitting better power output control, because it is common for subjects who are fatigued or unable to cooperate to decrease their pedaling speed. The highest values of VO2 and heart rate are obtained with pedaling speeds of 50 to 80 rpm. Cycles are calibrated in kiloponds (kp) or watts (W); 1 W is equivalent to 6 kp-meters per minute (kpm/min). Because exercise on a cycle ergometer is non\u2013weight-bearing, kiloponds or watts can be converted to oxygen uptake in milliliters per minute. METs are obtained by dividing VO2 in milliliters per minute by the product of body weight (in kg)33.5. The number 3.5 is the accepted value assigned to oxygen uptake while at rest and is expressed as milliliters of O2 per kilogram of body.\n\nRelative Sensitivity of Leads\n\nThe lateral precordial leads (V 4 through V 6) are capable of detecting 90% of all ST depression observed in multiple lead systems. ST elevation (over non\u2013Q-wave areas) is a rare but critical change due to transmural ischemia that occurs as frequently in lead V 2 and aVF as in V 5.\n\nRecorders\n\nThere are many good recorders designed to capture high-quality ECG data during exercise. Many use microprocessors\n---\n Figure 4\n\nRelation of METs to stages in the various testing protocols. Functional class refers to New York Heart Association class; kpm indicates kilopond-meters; MPH, miles per hour; and %GR, percent grade.\n\nFigure 4 demonstrates the MET levels at increasing loads and an adequate time interval in each level, given work rates (kpm/min) of a cycle protocol for a 70-kg person.\n\nThe cycle ergometer is usually less expensive, occupies less space, and is less noisy than a treadmill. Upper body motion is usually reduced, making it easier to obtain blood pressure measurements and to record the ECG. Care must be taken to prevent isometric or resistance exercise of the arms while grasping the handlebars.\n\nA major limitation to cycle ergometer testing is the discomfort and fatigue of the quadriceps muscles. Leg fatigue in an inexperienced subject may cause him or her to stop before reaching a true VO2 max. Thus, VO2 max is 10% to 15% lower in cycle versus treadmill testing in those not accustomed to cycling.\n\n Cycle Ergometer\n\nFor cycle ergometry, the initial power output is usually 10 or 25 W (150 kpm/min), usually followed by increases of 25 W every 2 or 3 minutes until end points are reached.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4536, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44a2adc3-53a0-4cf6-965e-9c8ee2a797a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "44a2adc3-53a0-4cf6-965e-9c8ee2a797a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "61b4cf42-b31b-49c2-95e7-3daf8dbb3656", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "dca77f5123839a93f90912cc4819ec3b036f7460117211df5fb2179dbb880a15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5b37bf3-459d-4422-9230-915c47e2b3d7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "7b2728c2920d809a89e79cdb20cc547b5c9770ead3069957f0afae8d03b03b0e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a2d21380-719f-4494-a746-faf25c294fc3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "a5d0359f8eaffa262d9e2f684dd256e459f43318f5e42da413f03820461166f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The cycle ergometer is usually less expensive, occupies less space, and is less noisy than a treadmill.

If arm ergometry is substituted for cycle ergometry, a similar protocol may be used, except that initial power output and incremental increases are lower. Two-minute stages are most popular with arm ergometry.\n\n Treadmill\n\nThe treadmill should have front and/or side rails to aid in subject stability. However, subjects should be encouraged not to tightly grasp the front or side rails because this action supports body weight and thus reduces the workload at any given stage. It may be helpful if subjects remove their hands from the rails, close their fists, and place one finger on the rails to maintain balance after they are accustomed to walking on the treadmill. The treadmill should have both variable speed and grade capability and must be accurately calibrated.\n\n Protocols\n\nProtocols for clinical exercise testing include an initial warm-up (low load), progressive uninterrupted exercise with\n\nweight per minute. Several different treadmill protocols are in use and are defined in Figure 4 according to treadmill speed, grade, stage duration, and estimated METs. The advantages of the Bruce protocol are its use in many published studies and the value of 3-minute stages to acquire submaximal data. Its disadvantages are large interstage increments in work that can make estimation of VO2 max less accurate and a fourth stage that can be either run or walked, resulting in different oxygen costs. Some subjects are forced to stop exercising prematurely because of musculoskeletal discomfort or an inability to tolerate the high workload increments. Initial zero or one-half stages (1.7 miles/hour at 0% and 5% grades) can be used for subjects with compromised exercise capacities. The optimum protocol for any test should last 6 to 12 minutes and should be adjusted to the subject\u2019s needs.\n\nRamp protocols start the subject at a relatively low treadmill speed, which is gradually increased until the patient has a good stride. The ramp angle of incline is progressively increased at fixed intervals (ie, 10 to 60 seconds) starting at 0 grade, with the increase in grade calculated on the patient\u2019s\n---\n 1700 Circulation October 2, 2001\n\nComplications Secondary to Exercise Tests\nCardiac\n\u25cf Bradyarrhypmias\n\u25cf Tachyarrhypmias\n\u25cf Acute coronary syndromes\n\u25cf Heart failure\n\u25cf Hypotension, syncope, and shock\n\u25cf Deap\nNoncardiac\n\u25cf Musculoskeletal trauma\n\u25cf Soft-tissue injury\nMiscellaneous\n\u25cf Severe fatigue (malaise), sometimes persisting for days; dizziness; fainting; body aches; delayed feelings of illness\n\nThe 6-minute walk test is a functional test that can be used to evaluate exercise capacity in patients with marked LV dysfunction or peripheral arterial occlusive disease who cannot perform cycle ergometer or treadmill exercise. Patients are instructed to walk down a 100-foot corridor at their own pace, attempting to cover as much ground as possible in 6 minutes. At the end of the 6-minute interval, the total distance walked is determined and the symptoms experienced by the patient are recorded. This type of protocol uses a submaximal level of stress and thus correlates only modestly with VO2 max.

Multiple surveys confirm that as many as 10 MIs or deaths or both may be expected per 10,000 tests in those with CAD. Risk is greater in the post-MI subject and in those being evaluated for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. A review summarizing 8 studies of estimates of sudden cardiac death during exercise testing revealed rates from 0.0 (4 studies) to 5 per 100,000 tests. Table 3 lists 3 classes of complications secondary to exercise tests.\n\nGood clinical judgment should be foremost in deciding indications and contraindications for exercise testing. Although absolute contraindications are definitive, in selected cases with relative contraindications, even submaximal testing can provide valuable information. Table 2 lists absolute and relative contraindications to exercise testing. In any procedure with a risk of complications, the physician should be certain that the subject understands the risks and benefits of the test. Good physician-patient communication about testing is mandatory, and written informed consent should be obtained.\n\nPerceived Exertion\n\nThe subjective rating of the intensity of exertion perceived by the person exercising is generally a sound indicator of relative fatigue. Rather than using heart rate alone to clinically determine intensity of exercise, the 6 to 20 Borg scale of perceived exertion is useful (Table 4). Special verbal and written explanations about the rating of perceived exertion are available for subjects. Although there is some variation among subjects in their actual rating of fatigue, they seem to rate consistently from test to test. Thus, the Borg scale can assist the clinician in judging the degree of fatigue reached from one test to another and in correlating the level of fatigue during testing with that experienced during daily activities. In general, a Borg scale >18 indicates the patient has performed maximal exercise, and values >15 to 16 suggest that the anaerobic threshold has been exceeded.\n---", "start_char_idx": 22699, "end_char_idx": 25623, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa259c31-0222-45cb-99bc-8e943aa02b7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa259c31-0222-45cb-99bc-8e943aa02b7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "61b4cf42-b31b-49c2-95e7-3daf8dbb3656", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "dca77f5123839a93f90912cc4819ec3b036f7460117211df5fb2179dbb880a15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e987b32-2f46-453e-a96d-02debeda5e62", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "f12d0dbac0864979f6e44426ba6680f98b29ac681d3a7aae98e6bc1538cd71a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_61b4cf42-b31b-49c2-95e7-3daf8dbb3656_32_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'Description': {0: 'Onset of angina, mild but recognized as the usual angina-of-effort pain or discomfort with which the subject is familiar', 1: 'Same pain, moderately severe and definitely uncomfortable but still tolerable', 2: 'Severe anginal pain at a level that the subject will wish to stop exercising', 3: 'Unbearable chest pain; the most severe pain the subject has felt'}, 'Level': {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 4}}", "table_summary": "This table provides information on the risk classification for exercise training, specifically detailing Class C and Class D classifications.

Such subjects should not be encouraged to attempt greater workloads.\n\nPhysical Examination\n\nCardiac auscultation immediately after exercise can provide information about ischemia-induced LV dysfunction. Gallop sounds or a precordial bulge can result from LV dysfunction. A new mitral regurgitant murmur suggests papillary muscle dysfunction, which may be related to transitory myocardial ischemia. It is preferable to have subjects lie supine after exercise testing and allow those who develop orthopnea to sit up. In addition, severe angina or ominous arrhythmias after exercise may be lessened by allowing the subject to sit up, because ischemia may be decreased due to lower LV wall tension.\n\nExercise Capacity\n\nMaximal work capacity in normal individuals is influenced by familiarization with the exercise test equipment, level of training, and environmental conditions at the time of testing. In estimating exercise capacity, the amount of work performed in METs (or exercise stage achieved) should be the index measured and not the number of minutes of exercise. Serial comparison of exercise capacity in individual patients to assess significant interval change requires a careful examination of the exercise protocol used during both tests, cardioactive drug therapy and time of ingestion, systemic blood pressure, and other conditions that might influence test performance. Each of these factors must be considered before attributing changes in functional capacity to progression of coronary heart disease or worsening of LV function.\n\nA normal exercise capacity does not exclude severe LV systolic dysfunction. Mechanisms proposed to explain normal work performance in these subjects include increased peripheral oxygen extraction, preservation of stroke volume and chronotropic reserve, ability to tolerate elevated pulmonary wedge pressures without dyspnea, ventricular dilation, and increased levels of plasma norepinephrine at rest and during exercise. Many subjects with decreased ejection fractions at rest can perform relatively normal levels of exercise, some without side effects, whereas others report increased fatigue for some time after the test.\n\nHemodynamic Responses\n\nBlood Pressure During Exercise\n\nBlood pressure is dependent on cardiac output and peripheral resistance. An inadequate rise or a fall in systolic blood pressure during exercise can occur. An inadequate rise in systolic blood pressure (,20 to 30 mm Hg) or a drop can result from aortic outflow obstruction, severe LV dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, and certain types of drug therapy (ie, b-blockers). In some subjects with CAD, higher levels of systolic blood pressure exceeding peak exercise values have been observed during the recovery phase. In most studies, exercise-induced hypotension in association with other measures of ischemia predicts a poor prognosis, with a positive predictive value of 50% for left main or triple-vessel disease. Exercise-induced hypotension is also associated with\n\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on April 7, 2024\n\nResponses in Subjects With Normal Resting ECGs\n\nP Wave\n\nDuring exercise, P wave magnitude increases significantly in inferior leads.

Ideally, 3 consecutive beats in the same lead with a stable baseline should be identified and the average displacement determined. The 3 key measurements are identification of the P-Q junction (isoelectric line), the J point (ie, J junction, QRS end, and ST segment beginning), and 60 or 80 ms after the J point. At ventricular rates .130 beats/min, 60 ms after the J junction is optimal to determine the extent of ST segment displacement in patients with an upsloping ST segment slope. When the J point relative to the P-Q junction is depressed at baseline, the net difference from the J junction determines the magnitude of exercise-induced displacement. When the J junction is elevated at rest (early repolarization) and progressively becomes more depressed during exercise, the magnitude of ST-segment displacement is determined from the P-Q junction and not from the resting elevated J junction. Exercise-induced myocardial ischemia can result in 1 of the following 3 ST segment manifestations on the surface ECG: depression, elevation, or normalization.\n\nST Segment Depression\n\nST segment depression is the most common manifestation of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. The ST segment depression represents electrical gradients caused by myocardial depressurization. The standard criterion for this abnormal response is horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression of $0.10 mV (1 mm) for 80 ms. However, as shown in Figure 5, other criteria have been considered. Downsloping ST segment depression is a more specific change than horizontal or upsloping depression. In the presence of marked baseline abnormalities, exercise-induced ST segment depression is less specific for myocardial ischemia. Other factors related to the probability and severity of CAD include the degree, time of appearance, duration, and number of leads with ST segment depression.\n\nST Segment Elevation\n\nExercise-induced elevation may occur in an infarct territory where Q waves are present or in a noninfarct territory. The development of .0.10 mV of J-point elevation that is persistently elevated (.0.10 mV) at 60 ms after the J point in 3 consecutive beats with a stable baseline is considered an abnormal response.\n\nST Segment Elevation in Post-MI Patients With Q Waves\n\nPrior MI is the most frequent cause of ST-segment elevation during exercise and seems to be related to the presence of severe hypokinetic or akinetic LV segmental wall motion. Approximately 30% of subjects with anterior MI and 15% of subjects with inferior MI tested early after MI demonstrate exercise-induced ST segment elevation in Q-wave leads. The changes may result in reciprocal ST-segment depression that simulates myocardial ischemia in other leads. However, ST-segment elevation and depression in the same test may indicate multivessel CAD.

Myocardial imaging techniques will help distinguish the concomitant presence of a new myocardial ischemic zone from reciprocal changes induced by ST-segment elevation in Q-wave leads.\n---\n ST Segment Elevation in Subjects Without Prior Infarction\n\nST/heart rate slope .2.4 mV \u00b7 beats -1 \u00b7 min -1 is considered abnormal, and values .6 mV \u00b7 beats -1 \u00b7 min -1 are suggestive of 3-vessel coronary disease. The use of this measurement requires modification of the exercise protocol such that increments in heart rate are gradual, as opposed to more abrupt increases in heart rate between stages, which limit the ability to calculate statistically valid ST segment/heart rate slopes. The measurement is not accurate in the early phase after infarction. A modification of the ST segment/heart rate slope method is the ST segment/heart rate index calculation, which represents the average changes of ST segment depression with heart rate throughout the course of the exercise test.\n\nThe ST/heart rate index measurements are less than the ST/heart rate slope measurements, and an ST/heart rate index of 1.6 is defined as abnormal.\n\n ST Segment Normalization or Absence of Change\n\nAnother manifestation of ischemia may be normalization of or no change in the ST segment related to cancellation effects, but this is nonspecific. ECG abnormalities at rest, including T wave inversion and ST segment depression, reportedly return to normal during attacks of angina and during exercise in some subjects with ischemic heart disease, but these findings can also be observed in subjects with a persistent juvenile pattern on the resting ECG. This cancellation effect is rare but should be considered as a cause of exercise-induced ST segment \u201cnormalization.\u201d\n\n Diagnostic Value of R Wave Changes\n\nMany within-subject estimates of the variability of R wave amplitude changes during exercise in normal subjects have been reported. However, the average response in normal subjects is an increase in R wave amplitude during submaximal exercise, with a decline at maximum exercise. Exercise-induced changes in R wave amplitude have not improved diagnostic accuracy, despite use of several lead systems, clinical subsets of subjects, and different criteria for an abnormal response.\n\n T Wave Changes\n\nThe morphology of the T wave is influenced by body position, respiration, hyperventilation, drug therapy, and myocardial ischemia/necrosis. In patient populations with a low CAD prevalence, normalization of inverted T waves with exercise is a nondiagnostic finding.\n\n U Wave Changes\n\nU wave inversion is associated with LV hypertrophy, CAD, and aortic and mitral regurgitation. These conditions are associated with abnormal LV distensibility. Exercise-induced U wave inversion in subjects with a normal resting ECG seems to be a marker of myocardial ischemia and suggests left anterior descending CAD.\n\n ST/Heart Rate Index and Slope\n\nHeart rate adjustment of ST segment depression seems to improve the sensitivity of the exercise test, particularly the prediction of multivessel coronary disease, but this has not been consistently observed. Calculation of maximal ST/heart rate slope in millivolts per beats per minute is performed by linear regression analysis relating the measured amount of ST segment depression in individual leads to the heart rate at the end of each stage of exercise, starting at end exercise.\n\n Stress Testing With Imaging Modalities\n\nThe addition of various imaging techniques to exercise is particularly useful when the resting ECG has baseline abnormalities (eg, left bundle-branch block or resting ST depression .1 mm) that limit the accurate interpretation of the exercise ECG. Imaging also provides information regarding the location of ischemic myocardium and the size of the \u201cterritory\u201d at risk. Exercise or pharmacological stress imaging studies provide greater diagnostic accuracy than exercise ECG alone and are particularly useful when the results of the exercise ECG are equivocal or indeterminate.\n\n Exercise Echocardiography\n\nEchocardiographic images at rest are compared with those obtained while the patient performs stationary cycling or those obtained immediately after treadmill exercise.

ECG, heart rate, and blood pressure are monitored during each stage. 26,28 Echocardiographic images are obtained throughout with ECG gating and are then displayed in a quad-screen format allowing side-by-side comparison of baseline, low-dose dobutamine, peak dobutamine, and recovery images. A new or worsening wall motion abnormality constitutes a positive test.26 Dobutamine stress echocardiography has a reported sensitivity of 67% to 97% 26 (average, 80%) 29 and specificity of 65% to 100% 26 (average, 84%) 29 for the detection of CAD. Complications during dobutamine infusion include nausea, headache, tremor, anxiety, angina and atypical chest pain, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and hypertension or hypotension. 28\n\nVasodilators such as adenosine or dipyridamole can also be used to assess coronary perfusion during nuclear imaging or, less often, during echocardiography. These agents cause maximal coronary vasodilation in normal epicardial arteries. Due to autoregulation, arteries with stenoses recruit vasodilator reserve to maintain flow at rest and may even be maximally dilated at rest; therefore, they do not increase flow normally when vasodilators are given. The radioisotope is injected at peak vasodilator infusion and images are obtained at 15 minutes for thallium-201 and 1 hour later for Tc99m agents. Side effects include flushing, chest pain, headache, nausea, dyspnea, and atrioventricular (AV) block, which can be reversed with aminophylline. 27 Due to the short half-life of adenosine, side effects usually resolve with termination of the infusion. Vasodilator agents should not be used in patients with second- or third-degree AV block (without permanent pacemakers) and in patients with a bronchospastic disease 27 such as asthma or severe chronic obstructive lung disease.\n\nPharmacological Stress Testing\n\nPharmacological agents can be used to increase cardiac work in lieu of exercise or cause coronary arterial vasodilation to increase myocardial blood flow. Patients unable to undergo exercise stress testing for reasons such as deconditioning, peripheral vascular disease, orthopedic disabilities, neurological disease, and concomitant illness can often benefit from pharmacological stress imaging procedures.

Once a discriminant value that determines a test\u2019s specificity and sensitivity is chosen, the population tested must be considered. If the population is skewed toward individuals with a greater severity of disease, the test will have a higher sensitivity. For instance, the exercise test has a higher sensitivity in individuals with triple-vessel disease than in those with single-vessel disease. A test can also have a lower specificity if it is used in individuals who are more likely to have false-positive results. Sensitivity and specificity of exercise-induced ST segment depression can be determined by comparing the results of exercise testing and coronary angiography. From these studies, it can be seen that the exercise test cut point of 0.1 mV (1 mm) of horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression has 84% specificity for angiographically significant CAD; ie, 84% of those without significant angiographic disease had a normal exercise test. These studies had a mean sensitivity of 66% for significant angiographic CAD, with a range of 40% to 90% for 1-vessel disease to 3-vessel disease.\n\nRelative Risk and Predictive Value\n\nRelative risk and predictive value help define the diagnostic value of a test (Glossary). The predictive value of a test is greatly influenced by the prevalence of disease in the group (or individual) being tested. Bayes\u2019 theorem states that the probability of a person having the disease after the test is performed is the product of the probability of disease before testing and the probability that the test provided a true result. For example, an exercise ECG that demonstrates ST depression in a young asymptomatic person without cardiac risk factors is most likely a false-positive result. Conversely, exercise-induced ST depression in an elderly person with typical anginal symptoms is most likely a true positive result.\n\nWomen\n\nExercise testing has the same characteristics in women with an intermediate probability of CAD as it does for men. In calculating the probability of CAD as determined by age and symptoms, women usually reach intermediate probability 10 years later than men. In a series of 976 symptomatic women referred for exercise testing and coronary angiography, a low, moderate, and high risk Duke treadmill score (a method of estimating cardiovascular prognosis) was associated with CAD (\u226575% luminal narrowing) in 19.1%, 34.9%, and 89.2% of women, respectively.

Their prevalence is directly related to age and cardiac abnormalities. In general, ectopic ventricular beats are of concern in subjects with a family history of sudden death or a personal history of cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, or severe myocardial ischemia.\n\nComplete AV Block\n\nAcquired complete AV block at rest is a relative contraindication to exercise testing. Exercise testing can be conducted in subjects with congenital complete AV block if there are no coexisting significant congenital anomalies.\n\nSinus Arrest\n\nRarely, subjects develop long periods of sinus arrest immediately after exercise. Sinus arrest usually occurs in subjects with severe ischemic heart disease.\n\nPreexcitation Syndromes\n\nExercise may provoke, abolish, or have no effect on anomalous AV conduction in individuals with known Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. When exercise does not interfere with preexisting anomalous AV conduction, significant ST depression can be observed during exercise testing. In the presence of WPW syndrome, the ST depression may not be due to ischemia but may instead be a false-positive (indeterminate) occurrence. Although exercise has been considered a predisposing factor to initiate tachyarrhythmia in WPW syndrome, there is a low prevalence of tachyarrhythmias during or after exercise in WPW subjects.\n\nExercise may induce cardiac arrhythmias under several conditions, including diuretic and digitalis therapy. Recent ingestion of alcohol or caffeine may exacerbate arrhythmias. Because exercise increases myocardial oxygen demand, in the presence of CAD, exercise-induced myocardial ischemia could predispose the subject to ectopic activity. It seems that ischemia with ST depression is not as arrhythmogenic as ischemia with ST elevation. Exercise-induced arrhythmias are generated by enhanced sympathetic tone, increased myocardial oxygen demand, or both. The period immediately after exercise is particularly dangerous because of the high catecholamine levels that are associated with generalized vasodilation. Peripheral arterial dilation induced by exercise and reduced cardiac output, resulting from diminished venous return secondary to sudden termination of muscular activity, may lead to a reduction in coronary perfusion in early recovery while the heart rate is still elevated. The increased sympathetic tone in the myocardium may stimulate ectopic Purkinje pacemaker activity by accelerating phase 4 of the action potential, which provokes spontaneous discharge and leads to increased automaticity.\n\nExercise can suppress cardiac arrhythmias present at rest. This phenomenon has been attributed to the overdrive suppression of the ectopic impulse formation by sinus tachycardia that is caused by exercise-induced vagal withdrawal and increased sympathetic stimulation. Exercise-induced sinus tachycardia may inhibit automaticity of an ectopic focus because it \"overrides\" automaticity of the Purkinje tissue.\n\nHeart Failure\n\nRecent studies have proven that exercise testing is not only safe in the population of patients with heart failure but also adds significant clinical information to the care of these patients.

Although exercise capacity correlates poorly with indices of resting ventricular function, the inability to perform aerobic activity is a powerful prognostic indicator. In fact, impaired exercise capacity, as measured using gas analysis (expired air), has revealed that a peak VO2 \u02d9 #14 mL \u00b7 kg \u00b7 min \u20131 is associated with high mortality. In contrast, patients with peak VO \u02d9 2 values .14 mL \u00b7 kg \u20131 \u00b7 min \u20131 or .50% of the predicted value have a 1-year survival which is similar to that of the post-transplant population.\n\nThus, gas exchange analysis is recommended when exercise testing is being used to measure exercise capacity in patients with heart failure. The protocol chosen for testing is less important when gas exchange measurements are coupled with exercise electrocardiography because these measurements are protocol-independent. Protocols for testing can be chosen depending on the physical status and capacity of the patient being tested. In general, protocols should be chosen that last '8 to 12 minutes to the peak of exercise. Shorter but more aggressive protocols may not allow sufficient time during exercise to adequately measure the full physiological response to exercise. In patients with chronic heart failure, the exercise testing procedures are similar to those of the other populations mentioned above.\n\nHypertension\n\nThere is evidence that an exaggerated blood pressure response with exercise testing is predictive of future hypertension, may be predictive of future mortality from MI, and is associated with angiographic CAD.\n\nCardiomyopathies\n\nExercise testing has been used in subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy to determine exercise capacity, assess pulmonary\n---\n 1708 Circulation October 2, 2001\n\nPulmonary response to LV dysfunction, determine the grade of um in jeopardy) is difficult without the use of imaging ventricular ectopy, and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. Subjects with LV dysfunction may have reduced exercise capacity. There is often an inadequate increase in cardiac output during exercise, which limits VO2 max and exercise tolerance. Stroke volume at times may increase normally during upright exercise, despite a decrease in LV ejection fraction. Ventricular dilation facilitates use of the Frank-Starling mechanism. However, with increasing exercise, stroke volume and cardiac output often cannot continue to meet the increased demands.\n\nSeveral compensatory mechanisms have been proposed to explain the poor correlation between LV function and exercise capacity, including normal heart rate reserve and increased peripheral oxygen extraction.\n\nCardiac Transplantation Recipients\n\nThese subjects often undergo exercise testing to establish the exercise prescription for a supervised exercise program. Heart rate and blood pressure responses in these individuals are often blunted during the initial phase of exercise, and thus other end points such as perceived exertion or workload are best used as end points for exercise training. Exercise test protocols should be selected to provide slow increases in intensity of workload to allow time for the denervated heart to respond to circulating catecholamines, which are the mechanism for the increased heart rate response. Due to vagal denervation, these subjects have baseline tachycardia and a prolonged heart rate recovery period.\n\nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\n\nIn addition to dynamic outflow tract obstruction, exercise can precipitate sudden death due to arrhythmias as a result of this condition. Chest pain, an abnormal resting ECG, and exercise-induced ST segment depression are frequent.

Although discussion of prognosis is inherently delicate and probability statements can be misunderstood, most subjects find this information useful in planning their work, recreational activities, and financial status. The second reason for determining prognosis is to identify subjects in whom cardiovascular interventions might improve outcome.\n\nExercise test responses secondary to myocardial ischemia include angina, ST segment depression, and ST segment elevation in ECG leads without Q waves. Predicting the extent and severity of ischemia (ie, the amount of myocardial) is difficult without the use of imaging modalities. It is inversely related to the rate-pressure product at the onset of signs or symptoms of ischemia. Responses related to ischemia or LV dysfunction include chronotropic incompetence, decrease in systolic blood pressure, and poor exercise capacity.\n\nExercise capacity correlates poorly with LV function in subjects without signs or symptoms of heart failure, and exercise testing is not beneficial in identifying subjects with moderate LV dysfunction. LV dysfunction is better recognized by a history of heart failure or physical examination; diagnosis should be confirmed by an echocardiogram or radionuclide ventriculogram.\n\nSeveral subject groups have been studied to determine prognosis with exercise testing, including subjects after MI, those with stable CAD (including silent ischemia and subjects after coronary revascularization), and asymptomatic individuals. Each of these topics is discussed in detail in the \u201cACC/AHA Guidelines for Exercise Testing.\u201d\n\nExercise Testing After MI\n\nExercise testing is useful in the evaluation and management of patients after MI. As therapies and treatment strategies for MI have changed dramatically, the current role of exercise testing must be viewed in the context of the patients who present for testing. Shorter hospital stays, widespread use of thrombolytic agents, greater use of revascularization strategies, and increased use of b-adrenergic blocking agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors continue to change the clinical presentation of the post-MI patient. Details regarding exercise ECG testing and stress testing with imaging modalities in the post-MI patient are presented in the \u201cACC/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction.\u201d Exercise testing after MI yields information regarding risk stratification and assessment of prognosis; functional capacity for activity prescription after hospital discharge (this includes domestic and occupational work evaluation and exercise training as part of comprehensive cardiac risk reduction and rehabilitation); and an assessment of the adequacy of medical therapy (for example, in ischemia) and the need to use other diagnostic or treatment options.\n\nTiming and Protocol\n\nExercise tests can be characterized according to the time after MI when the test is performed and the protocol that is used. The timing of the predischarge exercise test continues to shorten, as does the hospital stay for patients with an uncomplicated MI. Predischarge exercise tests in the literature range from 3 to 26 days after MI. Postdischarge tests have been performed early (14 to 21 days), at 6 weeks, or 6 months after MI. Exercise protocols can be either submaximal or symptom-limited. Submaximal protocols have a predetermined end point, which is often defined as a peak heart rate of 120 beats/min or 70% predicted maximum heart rate or a peak MET level of 5. Symptom-limited tests are designed to continue until the patient demonstrates abnormal signs and/or symptoms that necessitate termination of exercise.\n---\n Fletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 1709\n\nFigure 6.

The use of b-adrenergic blocking agents after MI has increased over the past decade. Thus, the number of patients taking these agents at the time of their post-MI exercise tests continues to grow. b-Adrenergic blockers reduce the occurrence of angina and ischemic ST changes and lengthen the time to ischemia on exercise testing. Patients taking b-blockers after MI should continue to do so at the time of exercise testing. Because patients will be taking these medications for an indefinite period after MI, the exercise test response while on b-blockers provides information regarding the adequacy of medical therapy in preventing ischemia and arrhythmias, as well as controlling the heart rate and blood pressure response during exercise. Moreover, discontinuation of b-blockers solely for the purpose of exercise testing may expose the patient to the unnecessary risks of recurrent ischemia, arrhythmias, and adverse hemodynamic responses during exercise.\n\nSafety\n\nExercise testing after MI seems to be safe. The incidence of fatal cardiac events including fatal MI and cardiac rupture is 0.03%; nonfatal MI and unsuccessfully resuscitated cardiac arrest, 0.09%, and complex arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, 1.4%. Symptom-limited protocols have an event rate that is 1.9 times that of submaximal tests, although the overall fatal event rate is quite low.\n\nRisk Stratification and Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis among survivors of MI continues to improve as newer treatment strategies are applied. Data from large thrombolytic trials and earlier studies in patients not receiving thrombolytic therapy consistently demonstrate that those patients unable to perform an exercise test have the highest subsequent cardiac event rate. Uncomplicated stable patients in the era of reperfusion have a low cardiac event rate, even before undergoing further risk assessment by exercise testing. Recent studies are limited in that coronary revascularization interventions are often performed in individuals who demonstrate an ischemic response, thus reducing the predictive value of exercise-induced ischemia for cardiac death or reinfarction. Exercise test predictors of adverse outcome in the post-MI patient include ischemic ST segment depression >1 mm, particularly if at a low level of exercise or in the presence of compensated heart failure; functional capacity <5 METs; inadequate blood pressure response.\n\nChronic Ischemic Heart Disease\n\nExercise testing provides valuable information in ambulatory patients with chronic ischemic heart disease. Patients with excellent exercise tolerance usually have a good prognosis regardless of anatomical extent of CAD. When the Duke treadmill score is used, patients are at high risk (mortality of 5% per year) if their score is >11, which generally requires both angina and significant ST depression at a low level of exercise. Similarly, patients are at low risk (mortality <1% per year) if exercise capacity is >7 METs, with normal exercise ECG and no chest discomfort. Exercise scoring systems that incorporate exercise-induced ECG changes, exercise-induced angina, and exercise capacity improve the prognostic estimates over what could be obtained with the exercise ECG alone.

Cardiac Events in Subjects With Silent Exercise-Induced Ventricular Arrhythmias In subjects with CAD, exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias do not usually represent an independent risk factor for subsequent mortality or coronary events.\n\nIn the presence of unstable angina, asymptomatic (silent) ischemia detected by ambulatory ECG (Holter) recording seems to confer an adverse prognosis. Subjects with silent ischemia may be at greater risk for sudden cardiac death because they do not have an intact \u201cwarning system.\u201d However, in 3 large population studies of subjects with a high prevalence of CAD who underwent exercise testing, those with ST segment depression with or without angina during testing had similar prognoses. Ischemia is silent in '60% of subjects with ischemic ST segment depression. In patients with established CAD, silent exercise-induced ST segment depression confers increased risk of subsequent cardiac events; the magnitude of the prognostic gradient is a feature of patient selection criteria and coronary disease extent.\n\nExercise Testing After Coronary Revascularization Therapy The magnitude of improvement in exercise-induced ischemic responses and aerobic capacity after CABG depends in part on the degree of revascularization achieved and LV function. CABG has been shown to improve survival in one study of subjects with cardiomegaly in whom exercise testing determined aerobic capacity ,5 METs or a maximum exercise-induced systolic blood pressure response ,130 mm Hg. A second study of CABG subjects with exercise-induced ST segment depression .1.5 mm showed enhanced survival with surgery. In a third study, the greatest survival benefit after CABG was in subjects with exercise-induced ST segment depression .1 mm at workloads ,5 METs. In subjects with exercise capacity .10 METs, CABG could not be shown to improve survival compared with medical therapy. The diagnostic and prognostic utility of exercise testing late after CABG (.5 years) is greater than testing performed earlier, because late after CABG an ischemic response is more likely to indicate graft occlusion, stenosis, or coronary disease progression in the native circulation.\n\nAfter percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), restenosis occurs in '20% to 40% of patients, usually within the first 6 months (1 to 2 months after stent placement). Restenosis is more common in patients with diabetes, proximal disease in the left anterior descending artery and in those in whom the post-PTCA result is suboptimal. An abnormal exercise ECG response within a few weeks after PTCA may be secondary to a suboptimal angiographic result, impaired coronary vascular reserve in a successfully dilated vessel, or incomplete revascularization. For this reason, the predictive value of exercise electrocardiography to detect restenosis early after PTCA is suboptimal. Serial conversion of an initially normal exercise test immediately after PTCA to an abnormal test 6 months after PTCA, particularly when the latter response occurs at lower exercise workloads, is usually associated with restenosis. Exercise electrocardiography with imaging techniques early after PTCA can be used to help determine the need for\n\na staged procedure in a patient with multivessel coronary disease who undergoes single-vessel coronary angioplasty and to provide a referenced baseline for subsequent follow-up. Prognostic Scores Scores based on the coefficients from Cox proportional hazard models seem to be the optimal way of estimating cardiovascular mortality. The Duke treadmill prognostic score is the most widely used, and it is based on the presence of angina and ischemic ST depression during the test, as well as the peak duration (or MET level achieved). The sample Duke nomogram in Figure 6 is an example of the use of exercise testing to predict cardiovascular mortality.

A study using the Ellestad protocol in asymptomatic men and women with known CAD found that ECG ischemic changes and an exercise duration #5 minutes correlated with subsequent events in men .40 years but concluded the exercise ECG had limited value in women and in men #40 years. A recent study in 6100 asymptomatic men who were free of clinically detectable cardiovascular disease revealed that the occurrence of frequent premature ventricular depolarizations during exercise testing was associated with a long-term (25 year) increase in the risk of death from cardiovascular causes; no significant increase in shorter term risk was reported. With regard to subjects who are asymptomatic but have risk factors for CAD, the results of exercise ECG testing are different. In the Seattle Heart Watch Study, men with one or more risk factors (positive family history, smoking, hypertension [blood pressure .140/90 mm Hg], and hypercholesterolemia [total cholesterol .240 mg/dL]) and 2 abnormalities on exercise testing (chest pain, exercise ,6 minutes, ST depression .1.0 mm, or ,90% predicted heart rate) had a 30-fold increase in 5-year cardiac risk. Exercise testing was of no predictive value in the group with no risk factors. In the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial, hypercholesterolemic men with .1 mm of ST depression on exercise testing had a 5.7 times greater risk of death from CAD than those with a negative test. Interestingly, a positive test was not significantly associated with nonfatal MI. The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial reported a nearly 4-fold increase in 7-year CAD mortality among men with an abnormal exercise ECG and suggested that the exercise ECG might serve to identify high-risk men who could benefit from\n\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on April 7, 2024\n---\n Fletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 1711\n\nrisk factor reduction. Similar data regarding the use of the Mitral Stenosis exercise ECG in women and the elderly (age .75 years) are lacking. In fact, studies have reported a lower specificity for ST segment depression in women 69 and the elderly. 70,71 Therefore, in asymptomatic men .40 years of age with one or more risk factors, exercise testing may provide useful information as a guide to aggressive risk factor intervention. 72 The role of exercise testing in asymptomatic women and among the elderly (age .75 years) as a guide to identifying the high-risk patient for primary prevention requires further study.\n\nMitral Stenosis Subjects with mitral stenosis 78 may show either a normal or excessive increase in heart rate during exercise. Because stroke volume cannot be increased, the normal rise of cardiac output is attenuated and may eventually fall during exercise; this is frequently accompanied by exercise-induced hypotension.\n\nMitral Regurgitation Subjects with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation 79 maintain normal cardiac output during exercise. Blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG responses are usually normal. When mitral regurgitation occurs suddenly during exercise as a result of ischemic papillary muscle dysfunction, a flat response in systolic blood pressure can occur. Subjects with severe mitral regurgitation do not necessarily have a decreased cardiac output and limited exercise capacity.

Exercise testing is a more accurate measure of the degree of cardiac impairment than a physician\u2019s assessment of exercise capacity. VO2 max \u02d9 is the best noninvasive measurement of the exercise capacity of the cardiovascular system. Inability to reach 5 METs (,18 mL \u00b7 kg 21 \u00b7 min 21 ) without signs or symptoms is a criterion of disability used by the Social Security Administration. Determination of a subject\u2019s exercise capacity affords an objective measurement of the degree of cardiac impairment and can be useful in treatment. 80\n\nAssessment of Valvular Heart Disease The utility of exercise testing in clinical decision-making for patients with valvular heart disease is discussed in detail in the ACC/AHA\u2019s \u201cGuidelines for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.\u201d 73 Exercise testing has been used in subjects with valvular heart disease to quantify disability, to reproduce exercise-induced symptoms, and to evaluate responses to medical and surgical interventions. The exercise test has also been used to identify concurrent CAD, but there is a high prevalence of false-positive responses (ST depression not due to ischemia) because of frequent baseline ECG abnormalities and LV hypertrophy. Some physicians use exercise testing to help determine when surgery is indicated on the basis of a reduction in functional capacity or abnormal hemodynamic response.\n\nAortic Stenosis Effort syncope in subjects with aortic stenosis 75,76 is an important and well-appreciated symptom. Most guidelines for exercise testing list moderate to severe aortic stenosis as a relative contraindication for testing because of concern about syncope and cardiac arrest. Proposed mechanisms for exercise-induced syncope in subjects with aortic stenosis include carotid hyperactivity, LV failure, arrhythmia, and LV baroreceptor stimulation. Exercise testing is relatively safe in both the pediatric and adult subject with aortic stenosis when performed appropriately. Attention should focus on the subject\u2019s symptoms, minute-by-minute response of blood pressure, slowing heart rate, and ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. In the presence of an abnormal blood pressure response, the subject with aortic stenosis should take at least a 2-minute cool-down walk at a lower stage of exertion to avoid acute LV volume overload, which may occur when the subject lies down.\n\nExercise has an important role in the objective assessment of symptoms, hemodynamic response, and functional capacity, although ST segment changes are likely to be nonspecific.\n\nAortic Regurgitation Subjects with aortic regurgitation 77 usually maintain a normal exercise capacity for a longer time than those with aortic stenosis. During exercise, the decreases in diastolic duration and regurgitation volume favor forward output. As the myocardium fails, heart rate tends to slow, and ejection fraction and stroke volume decrease.\n\nEvaluation of Perioperative Risk for Noncardiac Surgery Details regarding the use of stress testing in the assessment of perioperative cardiovascular risk during noncardiac surgery are presented in the ACC/AHA\u2019s \u201cGuidelines for Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation for Noncardiac Surgery.\u201d Results of exercise testing with assessment of functional capacity seem to add to the risk stratification provided by the resting ECG in subjects without known CAD who are candidates for major elective noncardiac surgery. 3,82 However, pharmacological stress imaging techniques are preferred in patients who are unable to perform adequate exercise, particularly those patients before peripheral vascular surgery who are limited by claudication.\n\nAssessment of Special Populations The Elderly The optimal use of exercise testing in the elderly requires that age-associated changes in the response to aerobic exercise and age differences in the prevalence and severity of CAD\n---\n 1712 Circulation October 2, 2001", "start_char_idx": 44072, "end_char_idx": 48851, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ff8f34d-e45d-4dcb-91a7-a975db808e6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ff8f34d-e45d-4dcb-91a7-a975db808e6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "61b4cf42-b31b-49c2-95e7-3daf8dbb3656", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "dca77f5123839a93f90912cc4819ec3b036f7460117211df5fb2179dbb880a15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3c306b41-81d6-4fad-98fc-69e4343851e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "a24eabde5476fe55579ac27128686ac0986249d231028de734f1b0ac194f7b12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_61b4cf42-b31b-49c2-95e7-3daf8dbb3656_70_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'Age-Associated Alterations in Physiological Response to Aerobic Exercise': {0: 'Reduced aerobic capacity: decline in VO2 max of 8% to 10% per decade in nontrained populations', 1: 'Reduced maximal heart rate of 1 beat/min per year', 2: 'More rapid increase in systolic blood pressure with exercise', 3: 'Attenuated rise in ejection fraction and comorbid conditions be considered.

National surveys of exercise laboratories have documented very low overall risks of MI or cardiac death, and age has not been identified as a risk factor for these events. However, age-associated increases in isolated ectopic beats and nonsustained supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, even in clinically asymptomatic subjects, have been observed. The supervising clinician should be aware that myocardial ischemia or MI in the elderly may present as marked dyspnea rather than chest discomfort.\n\nExercise testing is well established as a useful tool for assessing the progress of patients with stable CAD and those after MI. Available data in the elderly, although more limited, suggest similar prognostic value in this age group. As in the general post-MI population, inability to perform treadmill exercise after infarction confers a high risk for future mortality. In 111 infarct survivors 64 years, one group observed a 1-year mortality of 37% in the 63 patients not eligible for exercise testing versus only 4% in those able to exercise. In the latter group, 1-year mortality was best predicted by the magnitude of systolic blood pressure rise during exercise; mortality was 15% in patients with an increase less than 30 mm Hg versus 1.8% in those with an increase greater than 30 mm Hg. The prognostic importance of systolic blood pressure response to exercise was confirmed in 188 post-MI patients 70 years.\n\nIn this latter study, peak cycle work rate less than 60 W, exercise duration less than 5 minutes, and increase in rate-pressure product\n---\nFletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 1713\n\n12 500 also predicted increased cardiovascular mortality. In contrast, ST segment depression and ventricular arrhythmia predicted recurrent MI and need for coronary revascularization but not mortality.\n\nIn older patients with stable CAD, exercise testing also has diagnostic and prognostic utility. In 419 CAD patients years, one study revealed that severe ST segment depression induced by cycle ergometry predicted triple-vessel disease. Ischemic ST segment depression predicted an increased risk of cardiac death in another study of older patients with stable CAD. Although not recommended for routine use in apparently healthy older adults, exercise testing has also demonstrated prognostic significance in such a population.\n\nIn summary, the utility and safety of exercise testing in the elderly are similar to those in younger populations. However, age-associated changes in exercise physiology and the frequent presence of both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbid conditions require concerted efforts to match the older patient with an appropriate exercise testing protocol.\n\nObese Subjects\n\nExercise testing is useful in the clinical evaluation of obese patients with known or suspected CAD. However, obtaining an accurate assessment of peak cardiopulmonary responses often poses a challenge in this patient population. For many obese patients, particularly the morbidly obese, this is related to gait instability, low functional capacity, coexisting orthopedic impairments, and uneven body weight distribution. In one study, 25 obese women (mean body mass index, 40 kg/m) were assigned to various ramp and Bruce or modified Bruce protocols on the basis of a pretest activity questionnaire. Despite a longer time to reach fatigue using the ramp protocols, mean peak VO2 was not significantly different between tests. In another study, obese subjects with CAD were assigned to 2 severe energy-deficient study groups (one with exercise and the other by diet) plus a control group. All had exercise testing with VO2 studies 6 times in a 2-year period with the Weber-Janicki protocol. There were no differences between groups with the testing methodology, and all completed each test with satisfactory end points. In conclusion, these 2 studies and clinical experience reveal that obese subjects can have exercise tests effectively performed using a variety of protocols. Low-impact walking protocols, however, are preferred in this patient population.\n\nThe Physically Disabled\n\nSpecial protocols are available for testing musculoskeletally disabled subjects, especially those with hemiplegia or paresis after stroke or those with lower limb amputation or spinal cord injury. Many testing protocols use arm cycle ergometry with the subject sitting to optimize the exercise load, but some protocols consist of arm-leg or leg cycle ergometry. Safe and effective testing can be performed by most of these subjects.\n\nThe exercise testing method has been derived from a clinical trial that evaluated the effects of exercise on physically disabled subjects with CAD.

The accuracy of exercise testing in the emergency department setting follows Bayesian principles, with the greatest diagnostic and prognostic estimates in intermediate-risk clinical patient subsets. Exercise treadmill testing should be considered in patients who present to the emergency department with symptoms such as chest discomfort when they are classified as \u201clow risk,\u201d which includes the following: 2 sets of cardiac enzymes at 4-hour intervals are normal; ECG at the time of presentation and pre-exercise test shows no significant changes; the rest ECG has no abnormalities that preclude accurate assessment of the exercise ECG; and the patient is asymptomatic or has minimal atypical chest pain from admission to the time results are available from the second enzyme set.\n\nEarly exercise testing has been applied in patients with chest pain who are identified as low risk by clinical assessment, which may include a predictive instrument such as the Goldman computer protocol. Exercise testing has been implemented using 2 approaches. In the majority of studies, it is performed soon after presentation after an acute coronary syndrome has been excluded. Acute coronary syndromes are ruled out by an accelerated diagnostic protocol, which is usually performed within a 6- to 12-hour interval with serial cardiac serum markers and electrocardiograms. In the second, less common strategy, selected low-risk patients undergo \u201cimmediate\u201d exercise testing to stratify the group into those who can be discharged directly from the emergency department and those who require admission. Both methods have thus far been shown to be safe, informative, and cost-effective, although experience with the latter is considerably more limited than with the former.\n\nThe feasibility of \u201cearly\u201d exercise testing after excluding an acute coronary syndrome has been demonstrated by a number of recent studies involving from 100 to 400 patients presenting with chest pain and negative results on an accelerated diagnostic protocol. Patients with negative exercise tests were discharged, and those with positive results were admitted. No adverse effects of exercise testing have been reported. Direct discharge of patients after a negative exercise test reduced hospital admissions for the initial presentation by '50%. A negative exercise test was associated with no cardiac events at 30 days and at 5-month follow-up. Compared with patients with a positive test, those with negative tests had equivalent or fewer readmissions at 1 to 6 months. Substantial cost savings\n---\n Drugs and Exercise Testing\n\n\u03b2-Blockers\n\nSubjects with angina who receive \u03b2-blockers may achieve a higher exercise capacity with less ST segment depression and less angina if the drugs prevent them from reaching their ischemic rate-pressure product and therefore translate into a reduction in diagnostic accuracy. Maximum heart rate and systolic blood pressure product may be reduced. The time of ingestion and the dosage of these medications before testing should be recorded. Whether to discontinue \u03b2-blockers before testing was discussed under \u201cSubject Preparation.\u201d\n\nVasodilators\n\nThese agents can increase exercise capacity in subjects with angina pectoris. There has been no scientific validation that long-acting nitrates increase exercise capacity in subjects with angina when they are tested after long-term administration.\n\n Exercise Training\n\nRecent physical activity recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), the US Surgeon General, and the AHA have expanded the traditional emphasis on formal exercise prescription methodology to include a broader public health perspective with regard to physical activity.", "start_char_idx": 4225, "end_char_idx": 9586, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c7ecdf6-00da-4ca2-8e01-b970850c9359": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c7ecdf6-00da-4ca2-8e01-b970850c9359", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "61b4cf42-b31b-49c2-95e7-3daf8dbb3656", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "dca77f5123839a93f90912cc4819ec3b036f7460117211df5fb2179dbb880a15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c306b41-81d6-4fad-98fc-69e4343851e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "a24eabde5476fe55579ac27128686ac0986249d231028de734f1b0ac194f7b12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a38ec047-45b9-42ca-8d24-1652676aa412", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "46e7a09d5b1e71c269714c87101d45fab49b40118faceab845106365feea13c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Maximum heart rate and systolic blood pressure product may be reduced.

There has been no scientific validation that long-acting nitrates increase exercise capacity in subjects with angina when they are tested after long-term administration.\n\n Exercise Training\n\nRecent physical activity recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), the US Surgeon General, and the AHA have expanded the traditional emphasis on formal exercise prescription methodology to include a broader public health perspective with regard to physical activity. These reports have increased both professional and public awareness of the health benefits associated with daily\n---\nparticipation in physical activity, even at moderate-intensity activity; that is, activities that include both leisure time and those of a vocational and avocational nature. However, more intense activities, including activities of longer duration and more vigorous intensity, are likely to provide additional health benefits. Care must be taken to ensure that apparently healthy individuals who are beginning an exercise training program do not have detectable disease and that persons with known disease are stable, with no evidence of new or changing symptoms. Accordingly, medical evaluation should be obtained before entry into an exercise training program unless the anticipated activity is of light to moderate intensity, eg, brisk walking. Use of the risk stratification schema outlined in the section on \u201cMedical Evaluation and Exercise Prescription for Individuals With CAD\u201d can help determine the need for exercise testing and the level of subsequent supervision required during exercise training. Exercise testing should be routinely performed in persons with known or suspected cardiovascular disease before beginning an exercise training program. Care should be taken to exclude individuals from training who have evidence of unstable heart disease, such as unstable angina, uncontrolled heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, or complex arrhythmias. Training programs for persons with cardiovascular disease should be medically supervised until safe levels of activity have been established. The extent of medical supervision is discussed under the section titled \u201cTypes of Exercise Programming and Monitoring.\u201d\n\nExercise Training Responses\n\nApparently Healpy Individuals\nExercise training in apparently healpy persons impacts on several areas, including maximal oxygen uptake, central hemodynamic function, autonomic nervous system function, peripheral vascular and muscular function, and submaximal exercise capacity. Collectively, pese adaptations result in an exercise training effect, which allows an individual to exercise to higher peak workloads wip lower heart rates at each submaximal level of exercise.\n\nMaximal Oxygen Uptake\n\nVO2 max is the peak oxygen uptake achieved by muscular exercise. By strictest definition, VO2 max cannot be exceeded, despite an increase in power output. Although demonstration of the VO2 plateau against work rate is a valid demonstration of VO2 max, patients often cannot achieve the plateau because of leg fatigue, lack of necessary motivation, and general discomfort. Hence, it is customary to refer to VO2 max as the peak VO2 attained during volitional incremental exercise. In clinical practice, VO2 max is not usually measured during an exercise tolerance test but is estimated from the peak work intensity achieved.\n\nVO2 is the product of cardiac output and systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference. Increased VO2 max after training is associated with an increase in the capacity of the cardiovascular system to deliver oxygen (increased cardiac output) and of the muscles to use that oxygen (greater arteriovenous VO2 difference). Higher cardiac output after training is achieved solely by an increase in stroke volume, because maximal heart rate is not usually increased after training in normal individuals. On the basis of data in healthy subjects, a training effect can be achieved in a subject in the presence of selective or nonselective b-adrenergic blockade. However, such changes may be attenuated and/or may not be detected by metabolic exercise studies until after the drug is withdrawn.\n\nCentral Hemodynamic Changes\n\nAlthough a greater maximal cardiac output can be achieved after training, submaximal values are usually unchanged. Submaximal heart rate is reduced after training, with a concomitant increase in stroke volume. The mechanism of these changes is not known, although exercise training has resulted in an increase in myocardial contractility in animals.\n\nFigure 7 depicts relations of heart rate and stroke volume before and after training.\n\nAutonomic Nervous System Changes\n\nBlood and urinary catecholamine levels are lower at rest and during submaximal exercise after training, presumably because of less sympathetic nervous system activity. Parasympathetic tone may also be increased and, with sympathetic adjustments, may account for the slower heart rate and lower arterial blood pressures seen after training.", "start_char_idx": 8702, "end_char_idx": 14106, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a38ec047-45b9-42ca-8d24-1652676aa412": {"__data__": {"id_": "a38ec047-45b9-42ca-8d24-1652676aa412", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "61b4cf42-b31b-49c2-95e7-3daf8dbb3656", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "dca77f5123839a93f90912cc4819ec3b036f7460117211df5fb2179dbb880a15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c7ecdf6-00da-4ca2-8e01-b970850c9359", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "913208db507c3b89761a301eb1c1066f489f91a05153cfd61602ddfd161295b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "91d7fe4e-aaa4-4757-af13-d3917c95610f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "b0033d9f451db7bf48eff0cc0f2b260b8cd674dd53eeec633f2de53ac70f09f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, such changes may be attenuated and/or may not be detected by metabolic exercise studies until after the drug is withdrawn.\n\nCentral Hemodynamic Changes\n\nAlthough a greater maximal cardiac output can be achieved after training, submaximal values are usually unchanged.

Parasympathetic tone may also be increased and, with sympathetic adjustments, may account for the slower heart rate and lower arterial blood pressures seen after training.\n\nPeripheral Changes\n\nSkeletal muscle changes after exercise training include increases in oxidative enzyme concentration, capillary density, myoglobin concentration, muscle glycogen, and adaptation of muscle fiber type to a higher percentage of type I fibers. All potentially contribute to greater capacity to use oxygen and to better endurance.\n\nSubmaximal Endurance Capacity\n\nEndurance training enhances the individual\u2019s ability to perform exercise at both submaximal and maximal intensities, as demonstrated either by the ability to exercise longer at a\n---\n 1716 Circulation October 2, 2001\n\nSimilar workload or by increasing the workload attained at a given heart rate. 132 Improvements in endurance capacity are due to several factors, including greater availability of oxygen to exercising muscles (increased myoglobin concentration and capillary density), greater use of aerobic processes (greater concentration of oxidative enzymes), and increased muscle glycogen. 133 Furthermore, the results of these adaptations lower blood lactate levels and increase the anaerobic threshold. Adaptation to submaximal exercise is also associated with a lower rate-pressure product for a given exercise task, suggesting reduced myocardial oxygen demand for that level of work.\n\nIndividuals With Cardiovascular Disease\n\nAlthough exercise capacity increases with training when heart disease is present, the reported physiological changes seem to differ somewhat from those found in apparently healthy individuals. These are outlined below.\n\nPeak Oxygen Uptake\n\nSubjects with CAD have an increase in VO2 max with training. Although the absolute magnitude of the change is less in subjects with heart disease than that observed in apparently healthy individuals, the proportional increase is similar and may favorably impact on activities of daily living. The peak heart rate may be the same or slightly greater after training in those with heart disease. 134 The smallest absolute increments in VO2 max with training are seen in individuals with heart failure, but even in those subjects the improvement is of great rehabilitative value for restoring ability to perform daily activities.\n\nFigure 8. Change in rate-pressure product before and after exercise rehabilitation. Rate-pressure product (heart rate x systolic pressure) is shown at rest, during exercise, and during angina (A). After conditioning, more work can be tolerated because rate-pressure product (and hence myocardial oxygen uptake) is lower at rest and at each level of work intensity. Reprinted wip permission from Redwood et al. 141\n\nDecreased Myocardial Oxygen Demand\n\nExercise training has special significance for individuals with CAD because the changes promote lower myocardial oxygen demand at any given workload. These include lower heart rate, lower systolic blood pressure, and lower circulating catecholamines. The benefits of these adjustments can be demonstrated by the greater amount of work that can be done before angina and/or ischemic ST depression occurs. 141 Moreover, several provocative studies suggest that there is an improvement in myocardial oxygen supply (ie, coronary blood flow) at a given level of myocardial oxygen demand after training. 142\u2013144 There are many mechanisms, or combinations thereof, that may explain these findings, which are discussed in the section below. Figure 8 demonstrates the positive effects of conditioning exercise on angina. 141\n\nPreventive Value of Regular Physical Activity\n\nEffects of Exercise\n\nThere is now general agreement among public health and medical authorities that reduced physical activity on the job and during leisure time, which is commonly associated with modern lifestyles, increases the risk of fatal and nonfatal CAD events, as well as all-cause mortality.

National surveys during the past decade have consistently reported that '80% of American adults have insufficient physical activity for health benefits. 123,124 Thus, the AHA, the ACC, 145 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the ACSM, the National Institutes of Health, 146,147 and the US Surgeon General 124 have declared a sedentary lifestyle a major modifiable coronary risk factor. Other risk factors for which interventions have been proven or judged likely to reduce CAD risk are cigarette smoking, hypertension, elevated plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) and reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, elevated plasma triglycerides, obesity, diabetes mellitus, thrombogenic factors, and postmenopausal status. 145 Regular aerobic exercise has a\n---\nfavorable impact on a number of these risk factors, as well as Antithrombotic Effects Most major CAD clinical events are accompanied by coronary thrombosis. Emerging evidence suggests that exercise training favorably affects this process, in particular, the fibrinolytic system. In one study, strenuous endurance exercise for 6 months in healthy older patients resulted in a significant improvement in hemostatic indices, with a reduction in plasma fibrinogen levels, an increase in mean tissue plasminogen activator, an increase in active tissue plasminogen activator, and a reduction of plasminogen activator inhibitor. Short- and long-term exercise affect platelet activation. Platelet activation is important in the pathophysiological mechanisms of unstable coronary syndromes and acute MI. Available data suggest that short-term exercise can lead to increased platelet activity, especially in sedentary individuals, but regular, long-term exercise may abolish or reduce this response.\n\nEndothelial Function The vascular endothelium plays an important role in the regulation of arterial tone and local platelet aggregation, in part through the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors such as nitric oxide. This release is stimulated by various mechanisms, including the rise in shear stress associated with short- and long-term increases in blood flow. Endothelium-dependent dilation is impaired in patients with coronary atherosclerosis and in patients with coronary risk factors, including hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, and hypertension. Emerging evidence suggests that aerobic exercise improves endothelial function.\n\nAutonomic Function The balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity modulates cardiovascular activity. Enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity seems to be associated with an increased risk of cardiac events, particularly in those patients with known heart disease. Using measures of heart rate variability, cross-sectional studies of healthy men reported higher parasympathetic activity among those who were physically trained and fit compared with those who were not. Whether exercise affects autonomic tone among patients with cardiovascular disease is unclear. However, improved measures of heart rate variability with exercise training have been shown in patients with chronic heart failure and in patients after MI.\n\nAnti-Ischemic Effects There are a number of mechanisms by which endurance exercise training may improve the relative balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand and thereby result in an anti-ischemic effect. Increased metabolic capacity and improved mechanical performance of the myocardium are well-substantiated adaptations to endurance exercise training. Lowered heart rate and systolic blood pressure during submaximal exertion reduce myocardial work, thereby reducing myocardial oxygen demands and coronary blood flow requirements. Among patients with CAD, this allows a greater absolute workload to be accomplished before reaching the ischemic threshold. In addition, heart rate slowing\n---\n 1718 Circulation October 2, 2001\n\nwith training allows more time during diastole for coronary blood flow to perfuse the myocardium.

This may explain the lower rate of sudden cardiac death observed in physically active men with known or suspected CAD or a high risk of CAD. 155,157,159,170\n\nLipids There is much variability in the results of exercise/lipid lowering studies, at least in part due to the heterogeneity of the study methods, study duration, populations, exercise interventions, and the use of adjuvant interventions such as diet or pharmacological lipid-lowering agents. A meta-analysis of 95 studies, most of which were not randomized controlled trials, concluded that exercise leads to a reduction of 6.3% in total cholesterol, 10.1% in LDL cholesterol, and 13.4% in total/HDL cholesterol ratio and a 5% increase in HDL. 185 It seems that the training intensities required to yield modest improvements in lipids are not as high as those that lead to improvements in fitness levels, because HDL seems to increase across a broad spectrum of exercise intensities. A recent randomized controlled trial of moderate-intensity exercise (equivalent to brisk walking of 10 miles per week), Step 2 AHA diet, and the combination of diet plus exercise revealed that those in the diet plus exercise group demonstrated an 8% to 12% reduction in LDL and a 22% to 2% change in HDL level after 1 year. In this study, the addition of exercise to diet produced significant reductions in LDL that diet alone did not. Triglyceride levels were normal in these patients and did not change with exercise. 188 However, in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, a decrease of 15% to 30% can occur, particularly in those with insulin resistance. 189\n\nDiabetes Mellitus Physical activity has beneficial effects on both glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. These include increased sensitivity to insulin, decreased production of glucose by the liver, larger number of muscle cells that use more glucose than adipose tissue, and reduced obesity. 179 The effect of physical activity is an independent effect, but this is further increased with weight reduction. Obesity Exercise training is an important contributor to weight loss, although the effect of exercise is quite variable. It is not clear how much exercise is required to prevent weight gain or \u201crepeat\u201d weight gain, although it has been suggested that the levels may be much higher than the currently recommended doses of physical activity. 180,181 Most controlled exercise training studies show only modest weight loss ('2 to 3 kg) in the exercise group. However, when diet is added to the exercise program, the average weight loss is 8.5 kg, most of which is body fat, whereas a diet-only program results in a lesser weight loss (5.1 kg). Over the same study period, those undergoing neither diet nor exercise programming increased weight by an average of 1.7 kg. 182,183 These data strongly support the role of both exercise and diet in weight loss programs. Body composition and fat distribution are linked to cardiovascular mortality 182 and are improved by exercise. Physically active men and women have a more favorable waist-to-hip ratio (ie, less central obesity) than do sedentary individuals. 184 In general, the goal is caloric expenditure, and are improved by exercise.\n\nHypertension Two cohort studies have demonstrated that regular exercise reduces the incidence of hypertension. In addition to preventing hypertension, regular exercise has been found to lower blood pressure in hypertensive subjects. In mildly hypertensive men, short-term physical activity decreased blood pressure for 8 to 12 hours after exercise, and average blood pressure was lower on exercise days than on non-exercise days. In hypertensive black men, moderate physical activity performed for 16 to 32 weeks resulted in a decrease in diastolic blood pressure, which was sustained after a reduction in antihypertensive medication. Randomized controlled trials of exercise and blood pressure have revealed that regular exercise reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressures.", "start_char_idx": 21452, "end_char_idx": 26265, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a81e0adb-7674-4c32-8d50-6e80c0126e8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a81e0adb-7674-4c32-8d50-6e80c0126e8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "61b4cf42-b31b-49c2-95e7-3daf8dbb3656", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "dca77f5123839a93f90912cc4819ec3b036f7460117211df5fb2179dbb880a15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "24a03492-51d2-4afa-b868-c947f2bece7b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "88004976d649e2aa121b32d52dace8cfe79dd6744f13f1c435759dcef368ea9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_61b4cf42-b31b-49c2-95e7-3daf8dbb3656_80_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Relative\nType: \nSummary: None", "file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "ff37e66f5ae8beb5774cc066201e731cbf425584f114461067da43995371d2f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Physically active men and women have a more favorable waist-to-hip ratio (ie, less central obesity) than do sedentary individuals. 184 In general, the goal is caloric expenditure, and are improved by exercise.\n\nHypertension Two cohort studies have demonstrated that regular exercise reduces the incidence of hypertension.

Dose refers to the total amount of energy expended in physical activities that require repetitive muscular movement (usually expressed in kilojoules or kilocalories). Intensity can be defined in absolute or relative terms. Absolute intensity reflects the rate of energy expenditure during exercise and is usually expressed in METs. Relative intensity refers to the relative percentage of maximal aerobic power that is maintained.\n---", "start_char_idx": 102175, "end_char_idx": 103898, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfd0a218-8ce3-47da-9f94-136f60c5acc4": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfd0a218-8ce3-47da-9f94-136f60c5acc4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "61b4cf42-b31b-49c2-95e7-3daf8dbb3656", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "dca77f5123839a93f90912cc4819ec3b036f7460117211df5fb2179dbb880a15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_61b4cf42-b31b-49c2-95e7-3daf8dbb3656_80_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'Classification of Physical Activity Intensity*': {0: ' ', 1: 'Intensity', 2: 'Very light', 3: 'Light', 4: 'Moderate', 5: 'Hard', 6: 'Very hard', 7: 'Maximum\u2021'}, 'Endurance-Type Activity': {0: 'Absolute Intensity in Healthy Adults (Age), METs', 1: 'Maximum Voluntary Contraction, %', 2: ',20', 3: '20\u201339', 4: '40\u201359', 5: '60\u201384', 6: '$85', 7: '100'}, 'Strength-Type Exercise/Relative Intensity*': {0: ' ', 1: ' ', 2: ',10', 3: '30\u201349', 4: '50\u201369', 5: '70\u201384', 6: '$85', 7: '100'}}", "table_summary": "Table listing relative contraindications for exercise with a note that benefits can outweigh risks, if applicable.,\nwith the following table title:\nRelative Contraindications for Exercise,\nwith the following columns:\n- Relative: None\n", "file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "051a9d17f8ad9281ff5a03f15bcf2ae6706662c4890800f9342e7048c93c05c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_61b4cf42-b31b-49c2-95e7-3daf8dbb3656_82_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "", "file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "2180c417b27bdd39929b8a352dcb227e55c054277530fbe5bf9a9eb838b83d18", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "*Based on 8 to 12 repetitions for persons ,50 \u2013 60 years old and 10 to 15 repetitions for persons aged $50 \u2013 60 years.\n\n\u2020Borg rating of Relative Perceived Exertion (RPE), 6 \u201320 scale.\n\n\u2021Maximum values are mean values achieved during maximum exercise by healthy adults. Absolute intensity values are approximate mean values for men. Mean values for women are ;1 to 2 METs lower than those for men.\n\nAdapted from Reference 190.\n\nThe intensity of activity needed to improve physical conditioning varies among individuals and may be as low as 40% of VO2 max for 20 minutes 3 times per week. However, the relationship of exercise intensity to duration suggests that lower intensity exercise requires more time to increase functional capacity than higher intensity exercise. From a health and conditioning standpoint, the major advantage of moderate-intensity exercise is the decreased likelihood of complications, whereas more vigorous exercise has the advantage of accomplishing the goal in less time and in further increasing cardiovascular conditioning. Experience with normal populations suggests that activity $700 kcal (2940 kJ) per week is associated with higher peak exercise capacities. In studies of male college alumni, the risk of death became progressively lower as physical activity dose levels increased from an expenditure of 2.1 to 14.7 kJ/week (500 to 3500 kcal/week). There was a 24% reduction in cardiovascular mortality in subjects whose energy expenditure was .8.4 kJ/week (2000 kcal/week). Alumni who were initially inactive and later increased their activity levels demonstrated significantly reduced cardiovascular risk compared with those who remained inactive. The data regarding exercise intensity are much less clear than those addressing total dose. There is a growing body of evidence that regular, moderate-intensity activity (17 to 29 kJ/min; 4 to 7 kcal/min), performed by men and women of a broad age range, reduces cardiovascular mortality. A recent report involving 802 men (aged 64 to 84 years) concludes that more intense activity (.4 METs) is more strongly associated with lower cardiovascular mortality than is less intense activity. Another report noted that only energy expended during vigorous activity (.6 METs) was associated with a reduction of mortality among male Harvard alumni. However, at least 2 studies in older adults have demonstrated reduced mortality in walkers compared with in sedentary subjects. A threshold of intensity is probably required to achieve benefit, although the exact value is not known and may vary from one person to another. Although a threshold cannot be defined from available information, much of the exercise described in published reports that is associated with good health is at least moderate in intensity, such as brisk walking. Thus, it seems that beneficial exercise does not need to be of high intensity; the total amount of activity is more important for health than the performance of high-intensity exercise. Although somewhat greater benefits may accrue from vigorous exercise, more orthopedic injuries and higher dropout rates are associated with high-intensity exercise compared with low- to moderate-intensity programs. This is not to suggest, however, that better guidelines could not reduce the risk of vigorous exercise, providing an even greater overall benefit. Hence, current recommendations are directed toward minimizing risk and maximizing benefit.\n\nOccupational Activity\n\nEarly studies of occupational activity suggest that it can also provide protection from CAD. Although standing had no protective value, studies revealed that individuals who walked for long periods of time (such as postal employees) and those who engaged in heavy activity (longshoremen) obtained protection. Unless individuals walk for one hour or more each day as a part of their occupation (low to moderate intensity), they should supplement that activity with leisure-time exercise.

However, with judicious programs, activity is clearly beneficial in lowering mortality in groups that exercise compared with sedentary groups. Most recently, the incidence of major cardiovascular complications during outpatient cardiac exercise programs has been estimated to be 1 in 60 000 participant-hours. The type and intensity of activity and the use of monitoring apparently affect the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest. Table 9 shows that in cardiac subjects, incidence is lowest during activities that are largely controlled, such as walking, cycling, or treadmill walking. Table 9 also suggests that activities performed with continuous ECG monitoring have the lowest rates of sudden cardiac arrest compared with those that are unmonitored or only intermittently monitored.\n\nUnfortunately, these studies do not answer questions regarding the relative contributions of various other factors to sudden cardiac arrest. These studies strongly suggest, however, that the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest across a variety of activities, with the exception of jogging, is similar to that expected by chance alone. In subjects with heart disease, jogging seems to be associated with a greater incidence of sudden cardiac arrest compared with other activities. This is probably related to exercise intensity. Jogging at even the slowest pace may generate a VO2 that exceeds 80% of maximum for many untrained individuals.\n\n Myocardial Infarction\n\nMI is another risk associated with participation in exercise. It has been reported that MI during exercise is 7 times more likely to occur than sudden cardiac death. Exercise can be a potent trigger of MI. Approximately 4% to 20% of MIs occur during or soon after exertion. Physical exertion at a level of $6 METs has been reported within 1 hour of acute MI in 4% to 7% of patients. However, the adjusted relative risk has been found to be greater in persons who do not regularly participate in physical activity. Among sedentary persons, the relative risk of MI during exercise was 107 times that of baseline, whereas among individuals who regularly exercise 5 times per week, the relative risk of infarction during exercise is only 2.4 times greater than that of baseline. This inverse relationship between regular physical activity and MI is of clinical importance because healthcare providers must consider a subject\u2019s functional capacity when considering the risk/benefit ratio of exercise. It is clear that the least active subjects are at greatest risk for MI during exercise and that both leisure-time physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness have a strong inverse relationship with the risk of acute MI during exercise.\n\n Musculoskeletal Injuries\n\nMusculoskeletal injuries are common and include direct injuries such as bruises, sprains, and strains, and indirect problems such as arthritis and back pain. Low-impact exercises (walking, cycling, and swimming) cause less stress on bones and joints, whereas high-impact exercises (running and aerobic dancing) cause repeated impact on the knees, ankles, and feet. Studies indicate that the intensity and nature of impact of physical activity are the 2 most important factors in determining the frequency of injuries.\n---\n TABLE 10.

Circulation. 1999;99:963\u2013972.\n\n Pre-Exercise Training Medical Evaluation and Exercise Prescription\n\nThe following pre-exercise screening procedures and activity classifications (Tables 10 through 14) are presented as a means of beginning exercise with the lowest possible risk. They do not consider accompanying morbidities (eg, morbid obesity, severe pulmonary disease, or debilitating neurological or orthopedic conditions) that may necessitate closer supervision during training sessions. As the individual gains experience, the decision may be made to place the subject in another category.\n\n Pre-Exercise Screening\n\nBefore initiating an exercise program, the following recommendations should be applied to all potential exercise participants:\n\n1. A recent medical history and limited physical examination should be performed.\n- If the history or physical examination indicates significant cardiovascular disease, the person should be treated as noted in the section \"Medical Evaluation and Exercise Prescription for Individuals With CAD.\" Examples of cardiovascular disease include previous MI, CABG, angina pectoris, valvular heart disease, heart failure, and congenital heart disease.\n- If the individual knows of no cardiovascular disease but has symptoms or signs that suggest the presence of significant disease or has major coronary risk factors, an exercise test is needed before beginning an exercise program. Further evaluation should follow accordingly. If an exercise test cannot be performed, activity should be limited as outlined in the next section or pharmacological testing with dobutamine combined with an imaging modality should be performed.\n2. Age should be considered.\n- Among men <45 years and women <55 years without known or suspected cardiovascular disease, no further cardiovascular workup is needed, provided the issues outlined in section 1 are normal.\n- Among men \u226545 years and women \u226555 years, particularly those with diabetes or 2 other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the following should occur:\n1. An exercise test is recommended if vigorous exercise is planned. If the test is normal, no further restrictions are needed, although diabetics require special consideration. If the test is abnormal, further workup should follow accordingly and, for the purposes of exercise, the individual should be managed as if he or she has CAD.\n2. If the individual chooses not to undergo an exercise test, he or she should follow the activity guidelines outlined in Table 12.\n\nSetting: If the individual presents to a health/fitness facility as the initial step toward beginning an exercise program, screening procedures should take place as detailed in the \"Recommendations for Screening, Staffing, and Emergency Policies at Health/Fitness Facilities.\" This involves the use of screening questionnaires such as the AHA/ACSM Preparticipation Screening Questionnaire. These will prompt referral for medical evaluation by a healthcare professional when indicated.\n\n Classification for Exercise Risk\n\nAfter the medical evaluation is complete, subjects can be classified by risk on the basis of their characteristics. This classification is provided in detail in Tables 11 through 14, which are used to determine the need for subsequent supervision and the level of monitoring required.\n\n Medical Evaluation and Exercise Prescription for Apparently Healthy Individuals\n\nAlthough individuals may seem healthy, medical evaluation is important because of the potential for underlying medical problems, particularly those of a cardiovascular nature. In the healthcare setting, the evaluation should include a review of the individual's medical history and any current symptoms.\n---\n TABLE 11\n\nRisk Classification for Exercise Training: Class A: Apparently Healpy Individuals\n\nThis classification includes:\n1.

No evidence of myocardial ischemia or angina at rest or on pe exercise test at or below 6 METs.\n5. Appropriate rise in systolic blood pressure during exercise.\n6. Absence of sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia at rest or wip exercise.\n7. Ability to satisfactorily self-monitor intensity of activity.\n\nActivity guidelines: Activity should be individualized, wip exercise prescription provided by qualified individuals and approved by primary healpcare provider.\n\nSupervision required: Medical supervision during initial prescription session is beneficial.\n\nMedical History\n\nOf particular interest are data in the history that indicate unsupervised exercise may be hazardous. This includes CAD, significant valvular heart disease, heart failure, and congenital heart disease. If any of these heart conditions are present, the individual should follow the guidelines for individuals with heart disease in the next section. Persons taking cardiovascular medications should also follow the guidelines found in the next section. Obesity and neuromuscular disease tend to increase the risk of orthopedic injury and thus would suggest the use of lower intensity, low-impact exercise of longer duration in such persons (see subsequent sections).\n\nSymptoms\n\nSymptoms suggesting cardiovascular or pulmonary disease should be evaluated to exclude the presence of such disease. These include chest discomfort, dizziness, shortness of breath (at rest or with activities of daily living), and leg discomfort consistent with claudication.\n\nPhysical Examination\n\nHypertension requires assessment and management. Murmurs or sounds suggesting significant valvular heart disease or other signs of cardiac disease (e.g., heart failure) should be regarded as indicating the presence of cardiovascular disease until proven otherwise.\n\nDetection of Occult Disease\n\nOne of the most difficult challenges a physician may undertake is the detection of occult CAD. It is well known that individuals can have significant CAD in the absence of symptoms or signs and in the presence of a normal ECG and a normal exercise test. However, in the asymptomatic patient in whom CAD is strongly suspected, an exercise test may be useful in further evaluation.\n\nExercise Training Techniques\n\nTraining should consist of periods of warm-up and cool-down, endurance exercise, flexibility exercise, and resistance training. Such activities are performed to reduce the risk of injury or cardiovascular events associated with sudden onset of activity, increase functional capacity and muscular strength, improve the ability to sustain activities of daily living, and promote personal independence and positive self-image.\n\nWarm-Up and Cool-Down\n\nExercising at a low intensity for 5 to 10 minutes before (warm-up) and after (cool-down) the training session is a routine recommendation. Such activities help stretch and warm up muscles and ligaments in preparation for the activity session. The cool-down period also prevents hypotension, which may occur with the sudden cessation of exercise.\n---\n TABLE 13.

These characteristics include dynamic exercise, alternately contracting and relaxing the muscles (as opposed to isometric or resistance exercise), in large muscle groups, as in walking or running. Exercise should be performed 3 to 6 times per week for a minimum of 30 minutes per session at a minimum intensity of 40% to 60% V O2 max, and up to 85% to 90% VO2 max for those who have appropriately progressed to this level. In addition to brisk walking and running, other examples of endurance or cardiovascular activities are swimming, cycling, stair-stepping, and cross-country skiing. A useful approach to activity prescription is to identify the desirable rating of perceived exertion and instruct individuals to adhere to that intensity. A suggested rating of perceived exertion for most healthy individuals is 12 to 16 (\u201csomewhat hard to hard\u201d) on the Borg scale of 6 to 20, an approach that is both effective and acceptable. See Table 4 for more details on rating of perceived exertion.\n\n Flexibility Exercise\n\nProperly selected stretching exercises are helpful for promoting flexibility. Flexibility activities should focus on improving range of motion in a joint or series of joints. Particular attention should be focused on the lower back and posterior thigh regions in an attempt to reduce the risk of chronic lower back pain.\n\n Resistance Training\n\nResistance exercise training which involves activities that use low or moderate repetition movements against resistance has been accepted as a primary component of a comprehensive exercise program both for apparently healthy and, with appropriate screening and precautions, for subjects with cardiovascular disease. Although the effect of resistance exercise is less than traditional endurance exercise regarding its influence on risk factor modification, the increase in strength and potential for increased muscle mass may improve the individual\u2019s ability to become more physically active and raise the basal metabolic rate and may, in older persons, improve the ability to perform activities of daily living. Persons initiating a resistance training program should be carefully screened for both cardiovascular limitations and preexisting orthopedic and musculoskeletal problems. In addition, individuals should be provided with careful recommendations regarding the specific components of the resistance training program, including proper technique, number and types of exercises, and safety precautions.\n\nPrograms including a single set of 8 to 10 different exercises (eg, chest press, shoulder press, triceps extension, biceps curl, pull-down, lower back extension, abdominal crunch/curl-up, quadriceps extension or leg press, and leg curls/calf raise) that train the major muscle groups, when performed 2 to 3 days per week, will elicit favorable adaptation and improvement (or maintenance thereof). Although greater frequencies of training and more sets may be used, the additional gains among those in adult fitness programs are usually small. To achieve a balanced\n---\n Fletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 1725\n\nincrease in both muscular strength and endurance, a repetition may require 12 to 14 days. Accommodation to extreme heat never occurs. Symptoms or signs of heat injury may be varied at the onset; hence, any symptom should be regarded as evidence of heat overload. The following indications of heat stress are particularly likely to occur: headache, dizziness, faintness, nausea, coolness, cramps, and palpitations. If any of these symptoms are present, stop exercising immediately and go to a cooler environment. If the air temperature is .80\u00b0F, exercise in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat. Air-conditioned shopping malls are popular for walking. Exercise is better tolerated if humidity is low and a breeze is present. Exercise in the heat causes excessive fluid loss; therefore, adequate fluid intake is important before, during, and after each session.\n\n General Guidelines for Individual Exercise Programming\n\n1.

Physical activity is also associated with a reduction of the risk for the development or progression of CAD. However, certain precautions and guidelines are necessary to avoid cardiac events. In this section, the basis for activity programs for subjects with CAD and specific considerations are discussed, including recommendations for special populations to reduce cardiac events associated with activity.\n\nInpatients\n\nWhile the patient remains in the inpatient setting, walking is recommended as the major mode of exercise unless the\n\nOutpatients\n\nIn the outpatient setting, large-muscle group activities should be performed for at least 30 minutes, preceded by warm-up and followed by cool-down, at least 3 times weekly. The intensity of exercise should be designated by exercise prescription. Moderately intense activity ('40% to 60% of VO2 max) is effective for increasing both submaximal and maximal endurance if performed on a regular basis, and it is associated with a low incidence of sudden cardiac arrest. Follow-up supervised group sessions are recommended to enhance the educational process, to ensure that the participant is tolerating the program, to confirm that progress is occurring, and to provide the appropriate level of medical supervision in high-risk patients. Long-term follow-up is recommended to monitor compliance and to ensure that the program is being followed properly.\n\nCardiac rehabilitation sessions are typically serial in nature and emphasize patient education and risk factor modification. Core components of such programs include the following: nutrition counseling, medical assessment, lipid and weight management, smoking cessation, diabetic evaluation and monitoring, psychosocial assessment and intervention, activity counseling, and exercise training. The exercise prescription should include emphasis on appropriate levels of frequency, intensity, duration, mode, and progression. Activity is supervised during these sessions to ensure safety and may include ECG monitoring when deemed necessary for patient safety. The number of monitored sessions depends on individual patient characteristics, as outlined in Tables 12 and 13.\n\nExercise testing is an integral component of the rehabilitative process because it provides for the establishment of appropriate specific safety precautions, target exercise training heart rates, and initial levels of exercise training work rates. Exercise testing is also important in the risk stratification process, as outlined in Tables 12 and 13. Exercise tests should be performed on all cardiac patients entering an exercise training program and should be repeated at least annually or at any time the patient\u2019s condition warrants.\n\nAdditional evaluation of the patient\u2019s cardiac status (echocardiography, nuclear studies, or coronary angiography) may also be needed before entry into an exercise program.\n---\nTraining intensity can be ascertained by an exercise test. If a test is not performed, the exercise prescription must be more conservative and rely on the patient\u2019s rating of perceived exertion (see below), along with signs or symptoms to provide the upper limits of activity. Patients should always avoid activity that elicits inappropriate signs or symptoms.\n\nSteps in This Process of Prescribing Exercise Include:\n\n1. The target heart rate for moderate intensity exercise may be considered as 40% to 60% of heart rate reserve, as determined from the exercise test: [(maximal heart rate minus resting heart rate)3(40% to 60%)]1resting heart rate. This heart rate range can be used for the initial prescription of many types of dynamic exercise and can be increased to 85% (high intensity) if tolerated.\n2. Activities can be prescribed by designating the target workload that achieves the training heart rate after performance of 3 to 6 minutes at that workload (steady state). It may be expressed as watts on an ergometer, speed/grade on a treadmill, or in METs.\n3. Exercise intensity may then be assessed using the calculated target heart rate based on the equation above as a guide to the counted heart rate (manually or with a cardiotachometer). Cardiotachometers are widely available and are reasonably accurate for low-to-moderate intensity exercise. Supervision assures that the instructions are understood and that the activity is well tolerated.\n4. Individuals can also judge the intensity of exercise as the rating of perceived exertion, which can be equated to desirable heart rate range during supervised exercise and during other activities. The original scale is a 15-grade category scale ranging from 6 to 20, with a verbal description at every odd number (see Tables 4 and 7).", "start_char_idx": 134414, "end_char_idx": 139405, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1272e540-9adc-4bd3-8854-d843ede9f714": {"__data__": {"id_": "1272e540-9adc-4bd3-8854-d843ede9f714", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "61b4cf42-b31b-49c2-95e7-3daf8dbb3656", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "dca77f5123839a93f90912cc4819ec3b036f7460117211df5fb2179dbb880a15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f0872dd-0986-4100-8470-9c43fb08448b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "05185309ba34ae735ce4aa32dc1c4de9d7e789dd820845446936bd21fb1a1801", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "946b2cbb-a018-4d14-9578-a360b4c2d827", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2001).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387587, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "44006d81471dd3018dc8f81fc334a36401f719a8d8f2db5d1322778d2c967772", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It may be expressed as watts on an ergometer, speed/grade on a treadmill, or in METs.\n3.

The original scale is a 15-grade category scale ranging from 6 to 20, with a verbal description at every odd number (see Tables 4 and 7). The following rating of perceived exertion values should be followed:\n- &lt;12 is light, &lt;40% of maximal capacity (ie, VO2 max)\n- 12 to 13 is somewhat hard (moderate), 40% to 60% of maximal capacity\n- 14 to 16 is hard (heavy), 60% to 85% of maximal capacity\n\nActivities can progress as tolerance is demonstrated. The appropriate initial intensity of training is 40% to 60% of VO2 max or a rating of perceived exertion of 12 to 13 on a scale of 6 to 20. After safe activity levels have been established, duration may be increased as appropriate; later, intensity may be increased as heart rate response to exercise decreases with conditioning.\n\nExercise Prescription in the Presence of Ischemia\n\nThe exercise test results are the basis for the exercise prescription in patients with ischemia or arrhythmias. Myocardial ischemia manifesting as horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression and/or angina pectoris requires careful review when generating the exercise prescription. The exercise prescription is developed using the previously described methodology (40% to 60% of VO2 max), but with the designated heart rate and work rate below the identified threshold of ischemia (ie, angina and/or $1 mm ischemic ST segment depression on the exercise test). In general, the heart rate prescription should be a minimum of 10 beats/min below the heart rate at which the abnormality occurs.\n\nSpecial Considerations in Prescribing Exercise\n\nAll individuals must be carefully screened for medical status before beginning an exercise program. They must also have adequate instruction and follow-up to lessen the likelihood of complications. Furthermore, special considerations must be made in patients with potential limitations at program entrance. The principles of surveillance for safety and expectations for improvement are largely intended for subjects with CAD but may also apply to other subjects with a variety of noncoronary cardiac, vascular, and pulmonary diseases and other conditions, as will be discussed. Safety is the major reason for establishing special guidelines for subjects with cardiovascular disease. These recommendations should be considered appropriate for any condition associated with a higher than normal risk for sudden cardiac arrest or MI during exercise.\n\nThe Elderly\n\nSpecial considerations must be addressed when prescribing exercise for the elderly. In these subjects, maximal end-diastolic volume increases, whereas maximal heart rate, LV ejection fraction, and cardiac output are all lower than in younger individuals. In the presence of CAD, these factors may affect the cardiac response to a given exercise prescription. In addition, the extent of disease and increased potential for exercise-related myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias in this age group may increase the risk of adverse events. A critical factor in an elderly (&gt;65 years) person\u2019s ability to function independently is mobility, the ability to move without assistance. The overall focus for exercise training should be to enhance health-related fitness components, while simultaneously assisting in the reduction of risk for various chronic diseases and improving overall quality of life. Considerable evidence exists that physical activity, both endurance and resistance-type exercise, can significantly improve these indices and provide for functional independence and overall well-being, especially in the older adult.\n\nAs with all other patients entering an exercise program, elderly persons should undergo a medical evaluation before initiating an exercise program. This assessment should include not only a \u201cfocused\u201d physical examination but should also identify any psychosocial limitations to participation, which are prevalent in this age group. For older, apparently healthy persons desiring to participate in a low-to-moderate intensity activity such as walking, an exercise test may not be required. However, for more vigorous activities and for all cardiac patients, an exercise test should be performed.

As with younger persons, the combination of endurance and resistance exercise is best for achieving the health and fitness goals of the elderly. However, despite the fact that exercise recommendations are similar, some specific comments regarding intensity, frequency, duration, and mode of exercise for the elderly are required. The exercise capacity of the elderly, both before and after exercise training, is usually lower than that observed in younger persons. Furthermore, because many in this age group have been sedentary for years, specific muscle groups are often markedly deconditioned. In addition, musculoskeletal limitations, particularly arthritis, can be severely limiting. Thus, it is important to recommend activities that require low-level energy expenditure, particularly during the first few weeks (40% to 50% of VO2 max) of the program, and prescribe mild increases at any time when progression of activity is made. In these instances, however, participants are encouraged to increase the frequency of exercise (for shorter duration), even to perhaps 3 or 4 times per day. Higher intensity exercise training must be recommended with caution in this age group because of the potential for musculoskeletal injury.\n\nLike those whose exercise program intensity is significantly reduced, those persons whose exercise duration is limited (&lt;15 minutes/session) because of physical or psychosocial limitations should also attempt to exercise more frequently. Conversely, a recommendation to lengthen the duration of activity as appropriate beyond 15 minutes and to as much as 45 to 60 minutes per session is valuable for increasing caloric expenditure, but in doing so, a lesser intensity should be used. This regimen is associated with the improvement of a number of risk factors, including obesity, lipid abnormalities, hypertension, and elevated blood glucose.\n\nMany elderly persons have symptomatic concomitant medical and physical limitations (orthopedic, arthritic, and vascular) that may be exacerbated by weight-bearing exercise, especially higher impact activities such as jogging. Even walking, a light intensity exercise, may be difficult for the elderly person. Thus, even seemingly innocent activities should be carefully considered for potential adverse effects in this age group, especially when the activity requires individuals to bear their entire weight.\n\nResistance Training\n\nResistance training is generally safe in the elderly and can promote increases in and maintenance of muscular strength, neuromuscular coordination, and lean body mass while facilitating an enhanced quality of life. Many activities of daily living required for functional independence such as rising from a chair, climbing steps within the home, and lifting of household items require muscular strength more than muscular endurance. Increased muscle mass may also be helpful in increasing aerobic exercise tolerance in this population and, thus, should also contribute to functional capacity.\n\nThe process of increasing muscular strength begins for most elderly persons as they begin to exercise. Strength levels are often so reduced that even the aerobic exercise program will enhance strength. Conversely, debilitated patients may\n\nHeart Failure\n\nExercise training has been shown to be effective in improving functional capacity in patients with impaired LV function.

Exercise training yields important changes in skeletal muscle fiber type and function, leading to enhanced oxidative capacity. This is demonstrated by improved endurance and is associated with a reduction in the ratio of inorganic phosphate to phosphocreatine, an indirect measure of improved oxidative capacity. 247,248\n\nThe responses to exercise training in heart failure patients vary, although the majority of studies have demonstrated improvements in exercise capacity. Several factors may account for reported differences in the studies to date. The cause of heart failure, hemodynamic abnormalities, and peripheral limitations are heterogeneous in this patient group. Small subject groups and differences in the exercise prescription and medical course during the time of exercise training may influence the reported outcomes. Not all such patients will improve, and some may have an exacerbation of their condition while exercising. An increase in signs of mild-to-moderate hemodynamic compromise (using pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac output) with exercise training has been reported in heart failure patients with a peak VO2 #14 mL \u00b7 kg \u00b7 min, in contrast to those patients with a peak VO2 <14 mL \u00b7 kg \u00b7 min. Furthermore, heart failure patients with a low peak VO2 may also fail to demonstrate significant improvement in functional capacity after exercise training. 250\n\nIn those with heart failure, a training program should be initiated at a low to moderate level (25% to 60% of VO2 max) of the exercise capacity, preferably measured using a metabolic exercise test. Careful supervision and monitoring are particularly important during the initial training period. Telemetry monitoring during these early sessions is also recommended. Patients may begin sessions similar to those of other cardiac patients but may be limited in duration of activity until their endurance improves. Resistance training in this patient group may be beneficial, but the safety and efficacy of this type of training have not yet been well established.\n\nHeart Transplantation\n\nPatients with cardiac transplantation have generally been inactive before the procedure and remain deconditioned after the operation.

Frequency of activity is dependent on physician direction and may be as little as one session per week initially, working up to at least 3 sessions per week. Because the heart rate in a denervated heart rises more slowly in response to exercise and may remain elevated longer after activity, it is more difficult to use heart rate to monitor exercise intensity. The rating of perceived exertion in combination with other descriptors of exercise tolerance such as workload can be particularly helpful with this patient group. 258 Resistance training can be useful to offset the skeletal muscle loss and weakness due to corticosteroid use and general inactivity.\n\nSurgical Incision After CABG\n\nThe extent of healing of surgical incisions from CABG can be the most limiting factor for exercise.

Such patients need less restriction of activity.\n\nAfter Percutaneous Coronary Interventions\n\nBecause there are no specific studies that have evaluated the safety of exercise training within days after percutaneous coronary interventions, until such data are available, it is recommended that subjects begin or resume exercise no sooner than 5 to 7 days after the procedure. Care must be taken to assure that anginal symptoms are recorded and properly evaluated and that catheterization access sites are healed and stable. Exercise testing may be of considerable value in assessing new or different symptoms or in patients with incomplete revascularization (ie, those in whom not all stenotic lesions have been dilated).\n\nPacemakers and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators\n\nIf performance during an exercise test is satisfactory, individuals with pacemakers have problems similar to those of other cardiac subjects. Although the paced rate of some pacemakers can be accelerated during exercise, some cannot. The type and settings of a pacemaker should be noted, and exercise should be prescribed accordingly. Physical activity intensities in fixed-rate pacemakers must be gauged by a method other than pulse counting, such as defining specific workloads that are initially '40% to 60% of peak exercise capacity, as determined by the exercise test and by using the rating of perceived exertion. Exercise prescription for patients with defibrillators should be limited to a target heart rate that\n---\n 1730 Circulation October 2, 2001\n\nis at least 10 to 15 beats/min lower than the threshold cause for concern. Incremental increases in systolic blood discharge rate for the defibrillator. Diabetes Mellitus Patients with diabetes require special attention, especially if they are using exogenous insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications. Because they are prone to leg and foot wounds that may interfere with or be aggravated by exercise, initial medical evaluation should include an examination of the lower extremities. Patients should be advised to wear thick protective (preferably white cotton) socks and well-fitting supportive footwear during exercise. Patient history should include details regarding type of medication, timing and type of insulin used, and previous episodes of hypoglycemia. Patients should be counseled regarding the effect of exercise on blood glucose levels and the possibility of hypoglycemia, which may occur for several hours after the exercise session. Recognition and treatment of hypoglycemic episodes should be reviewed with diabetic patients.\n\nBlood glucose levels should initially be obtained before and after exercise to provide an assessment of the individual\u2019s response to exercise. The type of insulin (long or short acting), time of injection, last meal, and intensity of exercise should all be recorded because each of these factors can contribute to variations in blood glucose levels after exercise. In addition, glucose recordings may provide evidence for a change in insulin prescription. Blood glucose levels .100 and .300 mg/dL should preclude exercise at that time.\n\n Stroke Patients With Disabilities\n\nThe population of stroke subjects is increasing as our population ages. These stroke victims often have comorbidities of CAD and peripheral arterial disease. Functional impairments in this disabled group include paresis, paralysis, spasticity, and sensory perceptional dysfunction. Aerobic exercise training in the disabled stroke patient is safe and reduces the energy expenditure and cardiac demands of a designated activity. These subjects may perform a variety of aerobic activities; however, stationary cycle ergometry (arm, leg, and arm-leg) is most often used. Such activities can be modified to satisfy the needs of the individual. Limited data suggest that LV ejection fraction improves after upper extremity training.

Evidence also documents that reduction of risk of stroke in later life is conferred by exercise patterns in early years.\n\n Hypertension\n\nExercise is recommended as a component of the initial treatment for as long as 12 months in patients with stage 1 hypertension (140 to 159/90 to 99 mm Hg) with no other coronary risk factors and no evidence of cardiovascular disease, and for as long as 6 months in those with one other risk factor, not including diabetes. For patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease or those with stage 2 or 3 hypertension ($160/100 mm Hg), drug therapy should be initiated concurrently with exercise and other lifestyle modification programs. A slight increase in systolic pressure may precede exercise training sessions due to anticipation and is generally not a cause for concern. Incremental increases in systolic blood pressure during exercise are normal, although unusually high blood pressures (.190 mm Hg systolic), particularly during low-level activity, may warrant adjustment in medical therapy.\n---\n Fletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 1731\n\nThromboembolic Disease\n\nThrombophlebitis, arterial embolism, or pulmonary embolism should be treated with rest, even though factors that cause clot \u201cdislodgment\u201d are not clearly defined. Low-level walking or range-of-motion activity is probably safe as soon as the individual is in a stable treatment program and has had no recurrence of symptoms. A moderate exercise program can be started when the risk of recurrent events has stabilized.\n\nNeuromuscular Diseases\n\nNeuromuscular inflammation and injuries should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare professional to assess the appropriateness of exercise training and to determine the types of activities that are suitable.\n\nNew or Changing Symptoms\n\nChest Discomfort\n\nBoth the new occurrence and exacerbation of previous chest discomfort, whether typical angina pectoris or other forms of atypical chest discomfort, must be evaluated before initiating or continuing exercise.\n\nShortness of Breath\n\nThe occurrence of shortness of breath at rest may suggest pulmonary congestion, and appropriate assessment for cardiogenic pulmonary edema is needed. Some shortness of breath and fatigue may occur because of the deconditioning effect of bed rest after a cardiovascular event or surgery.\n\nEdema on the chest x-ray film, rales, or a third heart sound on examination will clarify the presence of significant pulmonary congestion.\n\nFaintness, Dizziness, or Light-Headedness\n\nThese symptoms may occur after a prolonged period of bed rest or inactivity, and they can be due to a contracted blood volume or loss of postural reflexes caused by inactivity or surgery. Such individuals will often have an orthostatic fall in blood pressure that may be hazardous if left untreated. Cardiac arrhythmias may also lead to such symptoms and thus should also be considered as a potential cause.\n\nWeakness and Fatigue\n\nThese complaints are common symptoms after a lengthy illness and need not necessarily be a concern. The sensation of fatigue will usually improve with time and conditioning. Weakness after cardiac surgery may occur because of low hemoglobin and may limit the early phases of cardiac rehabilitation. Restitution of hemoglobin to normal levels requires several weeks unless transfusions are administered. However, if these symptoms persist, additional evaluation and review of medication regimens should be done.\n\n Types of Exercise Programming and Monitoring\n\nLevels of supervision and monitoring must be considered on the basis of the type of patient, staff, facility, and resources. Details regarding administration and programming of cardiac rehabilitation are provided in the \u201cGuidelines for Cardiac Rehabilitation and Secondary Prevention Programs\u201d by the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation.\n---\n 1732 Circulation October 2, 2001\n\nand they should be encouraged to exercise.

Range-of-motion exercises and light calisthenics can be performed in an unmonitored setting. Activities are considered safe and appropriate if they meet the criterion of moderate intensity, as perceived by the physician or judged by an exercise test.\n\nGuidelines for Electrocardiographic Monitoring\n\nVarious recommendations exist regarding the number of ECG-monitored sessions that are necessary and reasonable in an exercise training program. There are no controlled clinical trials that have specifically evaluated this issue. Some programs use as few as 6 sessions, with progression in mode and intensity of the exercise during these periods, whereas others have used as many as 36 sessions of ECG monitoring.\n\nThe fewest possible sessions should be used, and it is recommended that the classification as outlined in Tables 12 and 13 be used as a general guideline. Importantly, the ultimate judgment must remain with the medical supervisor of the cardiac rehabilitation program and must consider the patient, staff, and exercise setting.\n\nIndividuals who are class A (apparently healthy) do not require ECG-monitored sessions because the general guidelines are adequate. Class B individuals should be monitored and supervised until they understand their desirable activity levels (usually 6 to 12 sessions). Class C individuals should be medically supervised with ECG monitoring until they understand the level of activity that is safe and the medical team determines that the exercise is well tolerated and effective. Usually 12 sessions are needed.\n\nECG-Monitored Cardiac Rehabilitation\n\nMonitoring sessions should ideally be performed with continuous ECG monitoring by either hardwired apparatus or telemetry. The sessions should be conducted by personnel who understand the exercise principles involved and have a working knowledge of electrocardiography and arrhythmia detection. The sessions should also be supervised by either a physician or a nurse trained in emergency CPR, preferably with previous experience in intensive cardiac care. Such individuals should have recently completed an AHA-sponsored course in Advanced Cardiac Life Support. Standing orders for the management of a complication should be immediately available. Monitored sessions should also include symptom assessment by the staff, blood pressure recording, the subject\u2019s rating of perceived exertion, and instructions to subjects about selection and proper use of exercise equipment. ECG-monitored sessions should include instruction for different modes and progressions of exercise.\n\nHome-Monitored Programs\n\nThe use of transtelephonic ECG monitoring at home has been suggested as a substitute for outpatient visits to the clinic. Such programs have the disadvantage of lacking immediate emergency medical care but the advantage of not\n\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on April 7, 2024\n---\nFletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 1733\n\ncounseling program might be enhanced through the use of encounter forms 281 and case management systems. 282 In addition, achieving greater implementation of physical activity interventions in healthcare settings will require improved education and training of health professionals and attention to healthcare policy and reimbursement issues.\n\nSocial Service and Vocational Rehabilitation\n\nHelping the individual return to normal activities and a healthy lifestyle is an important focus of rehabilitation and requires close cooperation between the subject, physician, employer, and social service agencies. Decisions about long-term goals should be made early. These goals include issues of personal safety, an acceptable (preferably optimal) standard of living for the subject, and productivity for the employer. Heavy labor can increase myocardial work and thus may increase the risk of myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac arrest. It may also pose a problem for employers who are liable for workers\u2019 compensation if a complication of heart disease occurs on the job. Most occupational activities require ,5 METs.

These exercise standards are intended for use by physicians, nurses, exercise physiologists and specialists, technologists, and other healthcare professionals involved in exercise testing and training of these populations. Because of an abundance of new research in recent years, a revision of these exercise standards is appropriate. The revision deals with basic fundamentals of testing and training, with no attempt to duplicate or replace current clinical practice guidelines issued by the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), and other professional societies.\n\nThe American Heart Association makes every effort to avoid any actual or potential conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of an outside relationship or a personal, professional, or business interest of a member of the writing panel.

Static exercise results in no movement of the limb.

Most exercise involves both dynamic and static contractions as well as aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, and depending on the contribution of each, the physiological responses can be significantly different. Current clinical exercise testing procedures manifest a predominant dynamic\u2013aerobic (endurance) component.\n\n Exercise Testing\n\nPurposes of Exercise Testing\n\nExercise testing has been used for the provocation and identification of myocardial ischemia for >6 decades, and during this time additional purposes for testing have evolved. Exercise testing now is used widely for the following:\n\n- Detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with chest pain (chest discomfort) syndromes or potential symptom equivalents\n- Evaluation of the anatomic and functional severity of CAD\n- Prediction of cardiovascular events and all-cause death\n- Evaluation of physical capacity and effort tolerance\n- Evaluation of exercise-related symptoms\n- Assessment of chronotropic competence, arrhythmias, and response to implanted device therapy\n- Assessment of the response to medical interventions\n\nUnderstanding the purpose of the individual exercise test allows the test supervisor to determine appropriate methodology and to select test endpoints that maximize test safety and obtain needed diagnostic and prognostic information. During the past several decades, exercise testing has been focused increasingly on assessment of cardiovascular risk, not simply detection of coronary obstruction. Ultimately, improved clinical outcome is a major goal of exercise testing.\n\n Physiology of Exercise Testing\n\nAerobic exercise, progressively increasing to maximal tolerance, is a common physiological stress that can elicit cardiovascular or pulmonary abnormalities not present at rest, while aiding in the determination of the adequacy of cardiac function. However, in addition to exercise, the cardiovascular response to physiological stress is also commonly evaluated through the use of pharmacological stress agents. Thus, whereas \u201cstress testing\u201d traditionally has referred to \u201cexercise,\u201d this term no longer remains precise. The following section will focus specifically on exercise as a means to provoke cardiovascular and pulmonary stress.\n\nTypes of Exercise\n\nExercise involves muscle activity that has both mechanical (dynamic, static) and metabolic (aerobic, anaerobic) properties. Dynamic (isotonic) exercise, which causes movement of the limb, is also further classified as either concentric (shortening) or eccentric (lengthening) of the muscle fibers, such as might occur when a weight is lowered against gravity.\n---\n Fletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 875\n\nHR Response\n\nThe immediate response of the cardiovascular system to exercise is an increase in HR that is attributable to a decrease in vagal tone, followed by an increase in sympathetic outflow. During dynamic exercise, HR in sinus rhythm increases linearly with workload and oxygen demand. In subjects not prescribed a \u03b2-blocking agent, the maximal HR achieved during exercise is influenced heavily by age and age-related neural influences; the expected value can be predicted from one of several available equations, some of which are derived separately for men and women. For one of the commonly used equations (maximum predicted HR=220\u2013age in years), a high degree of variability exists among subjects of identical age (\u00b112 beats per minute [bpm]). Accordingly, the practice of using achievement of 85% of age-predicted maximal HR to define sufficient effort during exercise testing is limited and should not be used in isolation as a termination criterion.\n\nDynamic exercise increases HR more than either isometric or resistance exercise. A normal increase in HR during exercise is \u224810 bpm per metabolic equivalent (MET). Moreover, the HR response is generally continuous with increasing workload. An accelerated HR response to standardized submaximal workloads is observed after prolonged bed rest, indicating that physical conditioning also plays a role in the HR response, which also can change in response to anemia, metabolic disorders, variable vascular volume or peripheral resistance, or ventricular dysfunction. These conditions themselves do not appear to affect maximal HR unless capacity for exercise intensity becomes limited. Conversely, a lower-than-expected incremental rise in HR during a progressive exercise test could be attributed to an enhanced level of fitness and left ventricular (LV) function. As will be discussed in detail, inadequate HR response to exercise can be a marker not only for sinus node dysfunction but also for prognostically important cardiac disease and has been defined as chronotropic incompetence. The use of a \u03b2-blocking drug lowers both the incremental rise in HR and maximal HR obtained during exercise, thus limiting the physiological interpretation of the cardiac response to exercise. Other factors that can influence HR include body position, type of dynamic exercise, certain physical conditions, state of health, blood volume, sinus node function, medications, and the environment.\n\nThe change in HR immediately after termination of the exercise test, termed HR recovery, has received an increasing amount of attention in recent years.", "start_char_idx": 3546, "end_char_idx": 9070, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbc60b09-9f2b-41aa-b5e6-454a97df36c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbc60b09-9f2b-41aa-b5e6-454a97df36c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "662b6283efdeaeacedfe39cf93b00e29fc39f207504b3937e500aca9e46054db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8b32db2-f60e-44cb-822a-cf4c6fc6cf87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "3f57688f416bf7fb768b84da1ffe8e0f2cd35eebcd7e7cd44187efbf29535fc3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a7325c3b-e79a-4da1-9b32-10cb27b3ea91", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "8cb96697a2219d6d96f665e5534141a22c889b07502cef2576736c7275925f52", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These conditions themselves do not appear to affect maximal HR unless capacity for exercise intensity becomes limited.

The decline of HR after exercise generally exhibits a rapid fall during the first 30 seconds after exercise, followed by a slower return to the preexercise level. The rapid decline in HR is likely the manifestation of vagal reactivation. Abnormality of HR recovery has consistently demonstrated prognostic value.\n\nArterial Blood Pressure Response\n\nBlood pressure is dependent on cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. Systolic blood pressure rises with increasing dynamic work as a result of increasing cardiac output, whereas diastolic pressure usually remains about the same or is moderately decreased because of vasodilatation of the vascular bed. On occasion, diastolic blood pressure sounds can be heard down to 0 mmHg in some normal subjects. A normal systolic blood pressure response to progressive exercise is dependent on both sex (higher in males) and age (higher with advancing age). The average rise in systolic blood pressure during a progressive exercise test is about 10 mm Hg/MET. After maximum exercise, systolic blood pressure usually declines because of the rapid decrease in cardiac output, normally reaching resting levels or lower within 6 minutes, and even remaining lower than preexercise levels for several hours. When exercise is terminated abruptly, some healthy people have precipitous drops in systolic blood pressure because of venous pooling (particularly in the upright position) and a delayed immediate postexercise increase in systemic vascular resistance to match the reduction in cardiac output. This postexercise hemodynamic response highlights the importance of an active cool-down period when possible.\n\nMyocardial Oxygen Uptake\n\nMyocardial oxygen uptake is determined primarily by intramyocardial wall stress (ie, the product of LV pressure and volume, divided by LV wall thickness), contractility, and HR. Accurate measurement of myocardial oxygen uptake requires cardiac catheterization to obtain coronary arterial and venous oxygen content. However, myocardial oxygen uptake can be estimated during clinical exercise testing by the product of HR and systolic blood pressure (double product or rate\u2013pressure product) and ranges from the 10th percentile value of 25000 to a 90th percentile value of 40000 at peak exercise. A linear relationship exists between myocardial oxygen uptake and coronary blood flow. During exercise, coronary blood flow increases as much as 5-fold above the resting value. A subject with obstructive CAD often cannot provide adequate coronary blood flow to the affected myocardial tissue to meet the metabolic demands of the myocardium during exercise; consequently, myocardial ischemia occurs. Myocardial ischemia usually occurs at the same rate\u2013pressure product rather than at the same external workload (eg, exercise test stage).\n\nOxygen Uptake and the Ventilatory Threshold\n\nVo\u03072max is the peak oxygen uptake achieved during the performance of dynamic exercise involving a large part of total muscle mass. It is considered the best measure of cardiovascular fitness and exercise capacity. By strictest definition, Vo\u03072max cannot be exceeded, despite an increase in work output. Although demonstration of the Vo\u03072 plateau against work rate is a valid demonstration of Vo\u03072max, patients often cannot achieve the plateau because of leg fatigue; lack of necessary motivation; general discomfort; or the presence of heart disease, LV dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, and associated symptomatology. Hence, it is common to refer to Vo\u03072max as the peak Vo\u03072 attained during volitional incremental exercise. In clinical practice, Vo\u03072max is not usually measured during an exercise tolerance test but is estimated from the peak work intensity achieved.\n\nIn contrast, submaximal oxygen uptake is the general designation for any level of oxygen uptake between maximal and resting levels. Submaximal oxygen uptake is most frequently described in terms of a percentage of Vo\u03072max (eg, 60%, 70%, or 80% of Vo\u03072max) in designating exercise workload or intensity.", "start_char_idx": 9764, "end_char_idx": 14865, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7325c3b-e79a-4da1-9b32-10cb27b3ea91": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7325c3b-e79a-4da1-9b32-10cb27b3ea91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "662b6283efdeaeacedfe39cf93b00e29fc39f207504b3937e500aca9e46054db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fbc60b09-9f2b-41aa-b5e6-454a97df36c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "ae4bcaf1699770ae4accf8179be8e602d0f25dccac16e2f897c618717678409a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac_20_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: General Guidelines for Endurance and Resistance Training\nType: \nSummary: None", "file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "3380159f88758121448d82a35d7fa512f63c20b5798e8c8f19655b657dfe2abb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Although demonstration of the Vo\u03072 plateau against work rate is a valid demonstration of Vo\u03072max, patients often cannot achieve the plateau because of leg fatigue; lack of necessary motivation; general discomfort; or the presence of heart disease, LV dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, and associated symptomatology.

Thus, it is difficult to accurately predict Vo\u03072max from its relation to exercise habits and age alone because of considerable scatter because of underlying disease.

If ischemia does not occur, the diagnostic value of the test for detection of CAD is limited. No formal guidelines for tapering or holding medications exist, but 24 hours or more could be required for sustained-release preparations, and the patient should be instructed to resume medication if rebound phenomena occur. Many exercise test evaluations occur while patients are taking usual medications, which should be recorded for correlation with test findings.\n- A brief history and physical examination are required to rule out contraindications to testing and to detect important clinical signs, such as cardiac murmur, gallop sounds, pulmonary wheezing, or rales. Subjects with a history of worsening unstable angina or decompensated heart failure should not undergo exercise testing until their condition stabilizes. Physical examination should screen for valvular or congenital heart disease, and abnormal hemodynamic responses to exercise in these patients could require early termination of testing. A resting supine standard 12-lead ECG should be obtained before exercise to compare to previously obtained standard ECGs to determine if changes have occurred over time. Subsequently, supine and standing (sitting if cycle ergometry is used) \u201ctorso\u201d ECGs (with the limb electrodes on the trunk\n---\n 878 Circulation August 20, 2013\n\nof the body to minimize motion and muscle artifact during increasingly popular to use digital conversion boxes that wire- exercise) should be recorded because these could differ lessly transmit to the recording electrocardiograph. importantly from the preexercise standard ECG. The torso Electrocardiographic Leads for Exercise Testing Because a high-quality standard 12-lead ECG with electrodes placed on the limbs cannot be obtained during exercise, electrode placement on the torso is standard for routine testing. Multiple leads improve test sensitivity. As noted, varied electrode placement results in varied waveforms. Although these do alter QRS and T-wave morphology, they are nonetheless valid for interpretation of heart rhythm and are generally similar to the standard ECG for detecting ST-segment deviation. Torso electrodes generally are applied under the lateral clavicles (for the arm leads) and high under the ribcage (for the leg leads), as shown in Figure 2. Nonstandard electrode placement should be documented on the tracing.\n\nStanding control torso-lead ECGs should be recorded before testing to allow direct comparison wip exercise tracings. If torso-lead tracings will be taken in pe supine position during recovery, a supine torso-lead tracing also should be obtained in pe control period. Blood pressures in pe upright position should be recorded before beginning exercise. Hyperventilation at rest could produce nonspecific ST-segment changes in some operwise normal subjects, and pese also might occur during exercise as false-positive responses for pe identification of ischemia. Hyperventilation before testing has been suggested to decrease test specificity, and its routine use has been criticized in a recent guideline. When electrocardiographic changes occur wip hyperventilation, pis should be acknowledged in pe test interpretation.\n\nElectrocardiographic Recording Skin Preparation An important factor governing the recording quality of an exercise ECG is the interface between electrode and skin. Removal of the superficial oils and layer of skin by gentle abrasion significantly lowers resistance, thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio. The areas for electrode application are first shaved and then rubbed with alcohol-saturated gauze. After the skin dries, it is marked with a felt-tipped pen and rubbed with fine sandpaper or other rough material. With these procedures, skin resistance can be reduced to 5000\u03a9 or less. Electrodes and Cables Disposable electrodes used in exercise testing are generally silver\u2013silver chloride combinations with adherent gel. Contact between electrodes and the skin generally improves with several minutes of application time and with the moisture that occurs with sweating during exercise, although excess sweating can result in loosening of the contact between electrode and skin.

Wrapping the torso with a 6-inch elastic bandage or with a fitted torso net can reduce noise produced by electrode and cable movement, especially in obese patients. Electrode placement for signal stability in large-breasted women can be difficult, sometimes requiring tradeoff of variable location and motion artifact.\n\nHard-wired connecting cables between the electrodes and recorder should be light, flexible, and properly shielded. Most available commercial exercise cables are constructed to lessen motion artifact by digitizing the electrocardiographic waveform at the cable box proximal to the attachment to the electrocardiograph recorder itself. Cables generally have a life span of about 1 year and eventually must be replaced to reduce acquired electrical interference and discontinuity. It is likely that much of this diagnostic value is attributable to the relationship of the derived lead to the axis of the left ventricle as a result of torso placement of the electrodes (which actually makes a torso-based \u2013aVR somewhat similar to CM 5 in axis). It should be noted that the spatial diagnostic information contained in aVR cannot exceed that of the other routine electrocardiographic leads because it is mathematically dependent on (and calculated from) any 2 bipolar limb leads. This notwithstanding, the clinical value of aVR (\u2013aVR) appears promising.\n\nElectrocardiographic Mapping During Exercise. Multiple electrodes in excess of the standard 10 can be used to derive body surface potential maps at rest and during exercise, which can provide additional insight into exercise-related ischemia.

Right and left arm leads should be placed outwardly on the shoulders (preferentially over bone rather than muscle).\n\nFigure 2. Placement of the limb leads on the torso is necessary for reduction of noise in the ECG during exercise, whereas precordial lead placement is unchanged. Waveforms of activity-compatible torso-lead ECGs differ from those derived from standard 12-lead ECGs, but ST-segment shifts with torso electrodes are valid. The manubrial electrode can be paired with standard lead V5 to produce bipolar CM5. From the figure, it can be seen that \u2013aVR (inverted aVR) using the torso electrode positions to produce the central terminal has spatial orientation that is similar in orientation to CM5.

The right leg lead (ground lead) should be placed below the umbilicus. The right leg lead is used for clinical exercise test purposes. Details are beyond the scope of the present statement.\n\nRelative Sensitivity of Leads: In general, more electrodes lead to greater test sensitivity. The lateral precordial leads (V4 through V6) are capable of detecting 90% of all ST depression observed in multiple lead systems, and recent studies have emphasized the general individual sensitivity of CM5 and (\u2013)aVR, both of which are in the general vector direction of the standard lateral precordial leads. Unlike ST elevation during acute MI, ST depression during demand-induced subendocardial ischemia during exercise does not localize the area of myocardium that is involved.\n\nComputer-Assisted Electrocardiographs: Because electrocardiographic artifact during exercise is an interpretive problem, most digitized resting and exercise ECGs use averaged updated cardiac cycles to generate representative complexes for each lead. These can involve incremental updating or averaging of multiple aligned cycles to reduce random noise and to reduce beat-to-beat variability caused by respiration and movement. Automated measurement of ST-segment shifts based on individual representative complexes has the potential to increase precision of the magnitude of repolarization deviation, but this is true only when reliable points determining baseline, QRS onset, and QRS offset (for determining the J-point and ST-segment levels at any specified time after the J point) are selected accurately by the computer algorithm.\n\nExercise Equipment: Details on exercise testing equipment and exercise testing laboratories can be found in the AHA\u2019s \u201cGuidelines for Clinical Exercise Testing Laboratories.\u201d Treadmill and cycle ergometers are the most commonly used dynamic exercise testing devices. Treadmill testing is generally favored in the United States, where bicycle riding is less prevalent than in Europe and elsewhere. Having both exercise modes available is advantageous, given that some individuals have difficulty with treadmill ambulation for reasons that include imbalance and orthopedic limitations, whereas other individuals develop earlier exercise fatigue using the bicycle.\n\nTreadmill: The treadmill should have front rails, side rails, or both to aid in subject stability. However, subjects should be encouraged not to tightly grasp the front or side rails because this action supports body weight and thus reduces the workload at any given stage, leading to the potential for a significant overestimation of oxygen uptake. It can be helpful if subjects remove their hands from the rails, close their fists, and place one finger of each hand on the rails to maintain balance after they are accustomed to.\n---\n Functional Clinical Cost METS BICYCLE TREADMILL PROTOCOLS METS", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3008, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "746e05f9-b495-4961-b27b-56217764ab8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "746e05f9-b495-4961-b27b-56217764ab8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "662b6283efdeaeacedfe39cf93b00e29fc39f207504b3937e500aca9e46054db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac_32_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'CLASS': {0: 'NORMAL', 1: 'AND', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: ' ', 8: ' ', 9: ' ', 10: ' ', 11: '0', 12: ' ', 13: ' ', 14: ' ', 15: ' '}, 'STATUS': {0: '1', 1: 'I', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: ' ', 8: ' ', 9: ' ', 10: ' ', 11: ' ', 12: ' ', 13: ' ', 14: ' ', 15: ' '}, 'COST mikg/min': {0: 56.0, 1: 52.5, 2: 49.0, 3: 45.5, 4: 42.0, 5: 38.5, 6: 35.0, 7: 31.5, 8: 28.0, 9: 24.5, 10: 21.0, 11: 17.5, 12: 14.0, 13: 10.5, 14: 7.0, 15: 3.5}, 'ERGOMETER': {0: '1500', 1: '1200', 2: '900', 3: '750', 4: '600', 5: '450', 6: '300', 7: ' ', 8: ' ', 9: ' ', 10: ' ', 11: ' ', 12: ' ', 13: ' ', 14: ' ', 15: ' '}, 'BRUCE': {0: '1350', 1: '1050', 2: '750', 3: '600', 4: '450', 5: '300', 6: ' ', 7: ' ', 8: ' ', 9: ' ', 10: ' ', 11: ' ', 12: ' ', 13: ' ', 14: ' ', 15: ' '}, 'BRUCE.1': {0: ' ', 1: '175', 2: '14.0', 3: '10.5', 4: '7.0', 5: '3.5', 6: ' ', 7: ' ', 8: ' ', 9: ' ', 10: ' ', 11: ' ', 12: ' ', 13: ' ', 14: ' ', 15: ' '}, 'NAUGHTON': {0: ' ', 1: ' ', 2: ' ', 3: ' ', 4: ' ', 5: ' ', 6: ' ', 7: ' ', 8: ' ', 9: ' ', 10: ' ', 11: ' ', 12: ' ', 13: ' ', 14: ' ', 15: ' '}}", "table_summary": "The table provides information on various studies related to exercise, physical activity, and cardiovascular health, including the impact of exercise training on markers of inflammation, vascular adaptation, myocardial perfusion, and autonomic function in individuals with heart conditions.,\nwith the following table title:\nStudies on Exercise, Physical Activity, and Cardiovascular Health,\nwith the following columns:\n- Study Title: None\n- Publication Details: None\n", "file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "af978a40a909273fe4ff4c543fc9886e95cb0aa175c9ef8f7c6cc4f7711a6ba9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac_44_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Article Title\nType: string\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Publication Details\nType: string\nSummary: None", "file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "78870f724af5db9d990835b7b412fc3cf388dcd6a3006d3033d0a113f60e5622", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Cycle Ergometer\n\nElectrically braked cycles vary the resistance to the pedaling speed (rate-independent ergometers), thereby permitting better power output control. The highest values of Vo2 and HR are obtained with pedaling speeds of 50 to 80 rpm. Cycle ergometers are calibrated in kiloponds or watts (W); 1 W is equivalent to \u22486 kilopond-meters per minute (kpm/min). Because exercise on a cycle ergometer is not weight bearing, kiloponds or watts can be converted to oxygen uptake in milliliters per minute. METs are obtained by dividing Vo2 in milliliters per minute by the product of body weight (in kilograms) \u00d7 3.5.\n\n Exercise Protocols\n\nProtocols for clinical exercise testing generally include an initial warm-up period (at low workload), followed by progressive graded exercise with increasing loads and an adequate time interval in each level, and a post\u2013maximum effort recovery period (again at low workload). Several different treadmill protocols are in general use and are seen in detail in Figure3. The test protocol should be selected according to the purpose of testing and the individual patient. Advantages of the standard Bruce protocol include its use in many published studies and its achievement of end-stage equilibrium. A disadvantage is the large interstage increments in workload between stages that can make estimation of Vo2max less accurate. Some subjects, especially those who are elderly, obese, or have gait difficulties, are forced to stop exercising prematurely because of musculoskeletal discomfort or an inability to tolerate the high workload increments.\n---\nW every 2 or 3 minutes until end points are reached.

For additional details about supervision and interpretation of exercise tests, reference is made to the document on clinical competence in stress testing from the ACCF, AHA, and American College of Physicians.\n\nAlthough exercise testing is considered a safe procedure, acute MI and deaths have been reported during testing. The physician or senior medical (healthcare) professional conducting the test must be trained in advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A defibrillator and appropriate medications also should be immediately available. Surveys suggest that 0 to 6 deaths or cardiac arrests per 10 000 tests and 2 to 10 MIs per 10000 tests might be expected, but these estimates will vary markedly with the prevalence and severity of underlying heart disease in the tested population.\n\nRisk is higher in patients being evaluated for malignant ventricular arrhythmias and in the unrevascularized post-MI patient, whereas serious complications are very rare in clinically normal subjects. Table 1 lists several classes of complications that can result from exercise tests.\n\n Perceived Exertion\n\nThe subjective rating of the intensity of exertion perceived by the person exercising is generally a sound indicator of relative fatigue. As an alternative to using HR alone to clinically determine intensity of exercise, the 6-to-20 Borg scale of perceived exertion is useful (Table 2). Special verbal and written explanations about the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) are available for subjects. Although there is some variation among subjects in their actual rating of fatigue, they seem to rate consistently from test to test. Thus, the Borg scale can assist the clinician in judging the degree of fatigue reached from one test to another and in correlating the level of fatigue during testing with that experienced during daily activities.\n\n Angina Characteristics and Scale\n\nLevels of anginal discomfort in those with known or suspected CAD are also excellent subjective endpoints. Whether typical angina occurs with exercise or is the reason for termination of the test is an important observation in the evaluation of the exercise test, and it is an important factor in the calculation of the Duke Treadmill Score.\n\nComplications Secondary to Exercise Testing\nCardiac\nBradyarrhypmias\nTachyarrhypmias\nAcute coronary syndromes\nHeart failure\nHypotension, syncope, and shock\nDeap (rare; frequency estimated at 1 per 10000 tests, perhaps less)\nNoncardiac\nMusculoskeletal trauma\nSoft-tissue injury\nMiscellaneous\nSevere fatigue (malaise), sometimes persisting for days; dizziness; body aches; delayed feelings of illness\nReproduced wip permission from Fletcher et al. \u00a9 2001 American Heart Association, Inc.\n---\n Table 2.

Symptom-limited testing is desirable for general evaluation, but this recommendation could be modified in several situations.\n\n Absolute Indications\n\n- ST-segment elevation (>1.0 mm) in leads without preexisting Q waves because of prior MI (other than aVR, aVL, and V1)\n- Drop in systolic blood pressure >10 mmHg, despite an increase in workload, when accompanied by any other evidence of ischemia\n- Moderate-to-severe angina\n- Central nervous system symptoms (eg, ataxia, dizziness, near syncope)\n- Signs of poor perfusion (cyanosis or pallor)\n- Sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or other arrhythmia, including second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, that interferes with normal maintenance of cardiac output during exercise\n- Technical difficulties in monitoring the ECG or systolic blood pressure\n- The subject\u2019s request to stop\n\n Relative Indications\n\n- Marked ST displacement (horizontal or downsloping of >2 mm, measured 60 to 80 ms after the J point [the end of the QRS complex]) in a patient with suspected ischemia\n- Drop in systolic blood pressure >10 mmHg (persistently below baseline) despite an increase in workload, in the absence of other evidence of ischemia\n- Increasing chest pain\n\n Management of Pacemakers and Implantable Defibrillators\n\nExercise testing can be used to assess rate responsiveness of implanted pacemakers and occasionally reveals abnormalities of tracking function that can limit effort capacity. In patients with implanted defibrillators that are triggered by rapid rate alone, firing function should be temporarily disabled before maximum testing if the threshold HR might be reached during exercise. In the presence of a ventricular paced rhythm, the ECG cannot be evaluated for ischemia, and it should be noted that \u201cpacemaker memory\u201d could produce abnormal repolarization that can mimic ischemia when long-term pacing is discontinued to examine the underlying electrocardiographic waveform.\n\n Clinical and Cardiopulmonary Responses During Exercise\n\n Clinical Responses\n\nAssessment of perceived symptoms is an integral component of the exercise test. Symptom assessment typically includes separate quantification of dyspnea, angina, and perceived exertion. Scales for each of these symptoms are provided in the present statement and other documents. Typical anginal symptoms induced by the exercise test are predictive of CAD and are even more predictive with associated ST-segment depression. Exercise limited by dyspnea seems to portend a worse prognosis than does angina or leg fatigue. It is important to obtain from the patient a careful description of all perceived symptoms during exercise and to document what the patient considers to be the primary limiting factor.\n---\n Fletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 883\n\nQuantification of patient-reported symptoms also can be used to prescribe an appropriate intensity for exercise training. Physical Signs The subject\u2019s general appearance during the exercise test is also of value and should be carefully observed during the exercise test. Signs of poor perfusion, such as cyanosis or pallor, and increasing nervous system symptoms, such as ataxia, dizziness, and vertigo, serve as absolute test termination criteria. Although the diagnostic value has not been confirmed, cardiac auscultation immediately after exercise has been proposed to assess cardiac function. \u201cGallop\u201d sounds, a palpable precordial bulge, or the development of a mitral regurgitant murmur after exercise could suggest LV dysfunction resulting from exercise.\n\nExercise Capacity Aerobic exercise capacity is one of the single best predictors of risk for future adverse events in apparently healthy individuals, those at increased risk for CVD, and virtually all patient populations, independent of other traditional risk factors. In a recent meta-analysis, it was reported that each 1-MET increase in aerobic capacity resulted in a 13% and 15% decrease in rates of all-cause death and cardiovascular events, respectively. Maximal work capacity achieved during an exercise test, which frequently is used to estimate aerobic capacity, is influenced by several factors, including patient\u2019s familiarization with the exercise test equipment, selection of an appropriate exercise protocol, patient\u2019s level of training, and environmental conditions at the time of testing.\n\nIn estimating exercise capacity, the amount of work performed in METs (or exercise stage achieved) is preferred to the number of minutes of exercise because protocols and conditions vary.

Age- and sex-predicted peak MET levels have been described previously in the present document, and peak values achieved have prognostic significance. Thus, aerobic capacity should be reported as both the actual value achieved and a percent-predicted value. To provide the most accurate estimation of exercise capacity, handrail use should be minimized when performing the test on a treadmill. Moreover, a conservative exercise test protocol, with smaller workload adjustments from one stage to the next, is preferable in patients with a diminished functional capacity.\n\nAll exercise testing procedures should be consistent when serial assessments are performed to assess therapeutic efficacy or disease progression. The use of ventilatory expired gas analysis greatly improves the reliability of key variables obtained from the exercise test.\n\nCardiopulmonary Exercise Testing Ventilatory expired gas analysis allows for the capture of minute ventilation (Ve), Vo2, and Vco2 through a face mask or mouthpiece. When combined with traditional testing procedures, this assessment is commonly referred to as cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX). CPX provides the most accurate noninvasive quantification of maximal aerobic capacity (ie, Vo2max or peak Vo2) and subject effort (via the respiratory exchange ratio: Vco2/Vo2). Commercially available ventilatory expired gas systems are also commonly capable of performing pulmonary function tests. Finally, several variables obtained exclusively from CPX, such as the VE/Vco2 ratio or slope and the partial pressure of end-tidal CO2, provide valuable diagnostic and prognostic information in certain situations.\n---\n 884 Circulation August 20, 2013\n\nQT-Interval Dynamics\n\nAs a result of the interval\u2013duration relationship, action potentials shorten as HR increases with exercise, and the resulting QT interval of the ECG is further affected by neurohumoral changes that accompany effort. In most normal subjects, the absolute QT decreases from the onset of effort, although in some subjects (more commonly women) there can be a paradoxical absolute QT prolongation in the early minutes of the test. When the measured QT interval is corrected for rate by the Bazett formula (corrected QT = measured QT/RR), it is common for the corrected QT to rise early in exercise and then decrease as rates increase at higher exercise workloads.\n\nAbnormal Electrocardiographic Changes During Exercise and Recovery in Ischemia\n\nST-Segment Deviation\n\nChanges in the level of the ST segment comprise the earliest abnormal finding in the history of exercise testing and have been the focus of standard test criteria for the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia for well over half a century. The ST level is measured relative to the end of the PR segment (the P\u2013Q junction) because the T(U)\u2013P segment during exercise is difficult or impossible to measure when HRs are fast. Three or more consecutive beats in the same lead with a stable baseline should be identified and the average magnitude and tangent direction of displacement at 60 to 80 ms after the J point determined, either manually or by use of computer-averaged complexes. It is essential to visually verify automated measurements made by computer.\n\nST-Segment Depression\n\nST-segment depression is the traditional manifestation of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. ST-segment depression recorded on the body surface represents the magnitude and direction of electrical gradients generated by ischemic vectors across the endocardium and epicardium, as well as the location of the recording electrodes. Upsloping, horizontal, and downsloping types of ST-segment depression are illustrated.

In the presence of prior Q-wave MI, this could represent reversible ischemia in the peri-infarct area or ventricular dyskinesis or akinetic LV segmental wall motion. Approximately 30% of subjects with anterior infarction and 15% of subjects with inferior infarction demonstrate exercise-induced ST-segment elevation in Q-wave leads.\n\nST-Segment Elevation in Subjects Without Prior Infarction\n\nIn subjects without previous infarction (absence of Q waves on the resting ECG), ST-segment elevation during exercise frequently localizes the site of severe transient combined endocardial and subepicardial ischemia resulting from significant subtotal proximal occlusive CAD. It also can occur during spasm in otherwise nonobstructed or mildly obstructed coronary arteries, but this is uncommon. Exercise-induced ST-segment elevation is more commonly associated with anatomically severe fixed proximal obstruction than with coronary spasm in otherwise unobstructed arteries.\n\nST-Segment Normalization\n\nRepolarization changes that are present at rest, including T-wave inversion and ST-segment depression, have been reported to normalize during clinical episodes of angina and during exercise in some subjects with ischemic heart disease. Normalization of the ST segment during exercise might be related to cancellation effects of oppositely directed forces from multiple areas of ischemia (ischemic counterpoise), which could explain false negative test findings in some patients with multivessel CAD. It is usual for young subjects with early repolarization to have normalization of resting ST-segment elevation during exercise.\n---\nST SEGMENT DEPRESSION DURING EXERCISE", "start_char_idx": 42287, "end_char_idx": 44468, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "813ef9bd-dd87-4150-ac7d-99c5b35f68dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "813ef9bd-dd87-4150-ac7d-99c5b35f68dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "662b6283efdeaeacedfe39cf93b00e29fc39f207504b3937e500aca9e46054db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0a641f72-7288-4678-8074-777ebe44da1f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "39af6132bb4882b17df030bf787c538377b6e5fe2cec4cfdb854ca5da986ea69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac_62_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "| |J-point only|Upsloping ST|Downsloping ST|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|No ST Depression| |Horizontal ST| |\n|60-80 ms after j-point|4.0mm (0.1mV)|1.0mm|1.0mm|1.0mm|", "table_summary": "This table provides a list of references related to exercise testing, cardiovascular health, and prognostic indicators.

Peak HR and because ST change is averaged over the entire HR change of exercise, with an ST/HR index of >1.6 \u03bcV/bpm defined as abnormal. 90,111Because it is calculated from only upright control and peak exercise data, the ST/HR index can be derived from tests that are not gently graded. The ST/HR index has been shown in retrospective application to improve prediction of coronary events in asymptomatic higher-risk men 113112 and also in asymptomatic lower-risk men and women. These methods require further prospective evaluation.\n\nRecovery Phase ST/HR Loops and Hysteresis. As the HR slows during early recovery from peak exercise, the recovery phase behavior of the depressed ST segment as it returns to normal differs in normal subjects and patients with ischemia. ST/HR loops and hysteresis provide alternative criteria for test positivity and negativity. After 1 minute of recovery, ST depression attributable to ischemia is generally greater than it was at the same HR during exercise, whereas in normal subjects it is less. 114 Extension of this principle to encompass measurement of the recovery phase area above or below the ST depression occurring with exercise forms the basis of ST/HR hysteresis, where the term hysteresis is used to indicate asymmetry of measured responses with respect to another variable occurring during exercise and recovery, such as time from peak effort, or in this case to matched HR during exercise and recovery. ST/HR hysteresis appears to provide higher diagnostic and prognostic test accuracy than that found for simultaneously measured standard ST-segment depression criteria and for the ST/HR indices.\n\nBeyond the ST Segment\n\nBecause the surface ECG reflects uncancelled summation of individual action potentials in the heart, and because demand-induced ischemia affects action potentials beyond alterations in plateau phase and resting membrane potential, it is reasonable to expect changes in the exercise ECG that extend beyond the ST segment, either alone or as modified for HR behavior. 116,118Several changes in the ECG during exercise-induced ischemia have been proposed as markers for obstructive CAD. Even though these findings are not used in routine test interpretation, they are described briefly in the\n---\n 886 Circulation August 20, 2013\n\nnext sections. It is emphasized that prospective evaluation of infarction has been associated with reversible ischemia during these criteria in larger, multicenter populations is required for clarification of their value and limitations. Combinations of criteria have the potential to improve test accuracy, but comprehensive prospective evaluation of the value and limitations of combinations of standard and alternative criteria in relevant populations is needed if further progress is to be made in exercise ECG.\n\nP-Wave Abnormalities. Among patients with chest pain evaluated by myocardial perfusion imaging, exercise-related P-wave duration and terminal P-wave amplitude in V1 have been reported to be greater in patients with reversible ischemia than in patients with normal scans, a finding that might be attributed to left atrial pressure overload during ischemia. An increase in P-wave duration by signal-averaging has also been associated with ischemia.\n\nR-Wave Amplitude Changes. The average response in normal subjects is an increase in R-wave amplitude during submaximal exercise, with a decrease at maximum exercise. An increase in R wave at peak exercise has been associated with myocardial ischemia, perhaps as a correlate of LV ischemic dilatation. Exercise-induced changes in R-wave amplitude have not consistently improved diagnostic accuracy of the exercise ECG, despite use of several lead systems, clinical subsets of subjects, and different criteria for an abnormal response.\n\nQRS Duration. Careful measurement of QRS duration during the course of exercise has suggested that absence of QRS shortening at peak exercise can be a marker for underlying CAD, particularly in women and in some situations with otherwise false-positive ST-segment responses.

An index based on exercise-induced changes in amplitudes of Q, R, and S waves was introduced as the Athens QRS score and has been related to the extent of CAD and to the anatomic extent of myocardial ischemia. The QRS score has been separately shown to complement ST-segment depression criteria for the detection of CAD.\n\nT-Wave Changes. An increase in precordial T-wave amplitude has been associated with the localized onset of apical asynergy during dobutamine stress electrocardiography. The morphology of the T wave is influenced by body position, respiration, hyperventilation, drug therapy, and myocardial ischemia/necrosis. In patient populations with a low CAD prevalence, normalization of inverted T waves with exercise is a nondiagnostic finding. In patients with CAD, findings have varied.

Sinus arrhythmias with periods of sinus bradycardia and wandering atrial pacemaker are relatively common during early exercise and the immediate recovery phase. Atrial ectopic contractions and atrial \"group\" beats can occur in either normal or diseased hearts. Exercise-induced transient atrial fibrillation and flutter occur in &lt;1% of individuals who undergo exercise testing. These arrhythmias can be induced by exercise in healthy individuals or in subjects with rheumatic heart disease, hyperthyroidism, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, or cardiomyopathy, and they can be problematic if the ventricular response is rapid. Paroxysmal AV junctional tachycardia is observed during exercise only rarely. Exercise-induced supraventricular arrhythmias alone are not usually related to CAD but are more often related to older age, pulmonary disease, recent alcohol ingestion, or excessive caffeine intake.\n\nVentricular Arrhythmias. Ectopic ventricular beats are the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia during exercise. Their prevalence is related directly to age and cardiac abnormalities. In general, ectopic ventricular beats are of concern in subjects with a family history of sudden death or a personal history of cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, or severe myocardial ischemia. VT can be nonsustained or sustained, and exercise-related types include catecholamine-triggered polymorphic VT and right ventricular outflow tract VT associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. The diagnostic and prognostic values of patterns of ventricular ectopy during and after exercise have been variable. Recent studies have suggested that frequent or complex repetitive ventricular activity during exercise, and particularly ventricular ectopy in the recovery period after exercise, can be independent predictive markers for death.\n\nDisorders of Impulse Conduction. Disorders of impulse conduction include abnormalities of normal impulse initiation and conduction through the heart.\n\nBundle-Branch and Fascicular Blocks. Intracardiac conduction blocks can exist before exercise, develop during exercise, or disappear during exercise. Rate-dependent intraventricular blocks that develop during exercise often precede the appearance of chronic blocks that develop later at rest. Both left and right bundle-branch blocks have been reported to occur during exercise. Diagnosis of myocardial ischemia from the exercise ECG is usually impossible when left bundle-branch block is present. There can be a marked degree of exercise-induced ST-segment depression in addition to that found at rest in normal subjects with left bundle-branch block, and there is no clear difference in ST-segment response to exercise between those with and those without myocardial ischemia. Left bundle-branch block that develops during exercise might or might not be associated with CAD, but it does predict higher risk of death and major cardiac events.

Left bundle-branch block that develops during exercise might or might not be associated with CAD, but it does predict higher risk of death and major cardiac events. The disappearance during exercise of intraventricular blocks that are present at rest is rare. Preexisting right bundle-branch block does not invalidate interpretation of the exercise ECG, except in the anterior precordial leads (V1, V2, and V3), where ST depression is frequently present at baseline and increases with exercise even in the absence of coronary obstruction. Because ST depression limited to these precordial leads alone is rare in myocardial ischemia, the usual diagnostic criteria can be applied in the remaining inferolateral leads. The development of right bundle-branch block during exercise is less common than the development of left bundle-branch block in populations with a high prevalence of underlying heart disease, but whereas left bundle-branch block occurs commonly in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathies, right bundle-branch block has been associated with underlying CAD as the origin of disease, particularly with obstructive disease affecting the left anterior descending artery. The strength of this association has been questioned by a recent study, and rate-dependency of the right bundle in less selected populations could limit predictive value.\n\nAV Conduction. Shortening of the PR interval (by as much as 0.10 or 0.11 seconds) during exercise as the sinus rate increases is normal, probably because of increased sympathetic tone and vagal withdrawal. This usually occurs in young, healthy individuals.\n\nFirst-Degree AV Block. First-degree AV block occurs occasionally at the end of exercise or during the recovery phase, particularly in the presence of occult AV node disease. Medications or conditions that can produce prolonged AV conduction time (eg, digitalis, \u03b2-blockers, some calcium channel blockers, inflammatory disorders of the heart) predispose the individual to lengthening of the PR interval.\n\nSecond-degree AV Block. The occurrence of Wenckebach-type (Mobitz type I) AV block during exercise is rare because vagal tone is reduced during exercise, whereas sympathetic neurohumoral tone increases. The clinical significance of exercise-induced Mobitz type II AV block generally is related to CAD or to aortic valve stenosis and could herald the development of permanent block, but type II block also can be a rate-related phenomenon that appears as the sinus rate is accelerated beyond a critical level. When second-degree AV block develops during exercise, the test should be terminated.\n\nThird-degree (complete) AV Block. Acquired advanced or complete AV block at rest is a relative contraindication to exercise testing because increasing sympathetic drive without effective rate increase can result in complex ventricular arrhythmias. Exercise testing can be conducted in subjects with congenital complete AV block if there are no coexisting significant congenital anomalies that reduce test safety. The development of complete block during exercise testing is uncommon, but it can be related to transient ischemia. Development of advanced or complete AV block should prompt termination of the test.\n\nExercise and Preexcitation Syndromes. Exercise can provoke, abolish, or have no effect on ventricular preexcitation in individuals with known WPW syndrome.

Reasons for these extraordinary ranges of values include marked differences in the characteristics of the populations studied, differences in definition of the presence and severity of disease, and differences in many additional factors that govern the diagnostic performance of a test, as described in the sections that follow.\n\n Sensitivity, Specificity, and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves\n\nSensitivity and specificity define how effectively a test separates subjects with disease from healthy individuals (i.e., how well a test diagnoses disease). Sensitivity is the percentage of those individuals with a disease who will have abnormal tests. Sensitivity is influenced by disease severity, effort level, and anti-ischemic drugs. Specificity is the percentage of those without the disease who will have normal test results, and it can be affected by drugs such as digoxin, by baseline electrocardiographic patterns, and by LV hypertrophy. Sensitivity and specificity are inversely related; when sensitivity is the highest, specificity is lowest, and vice versa. All tests have a range of inversely related sensitivities and specificities that can be selected by specifying a discriminant or diagnostic cut point. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis is used for evaluating the accuracy of a statistical model when cut points are used to classify patients as diseased or nondiseased. As a graphical tool, a receiver operating characteristic plot displays the test sensitivity on the y-axis against 1 minus the test specificity on the x-axis for varying values of the diagnostic cut point. The area under the curve provides a summary measure that averages the diagnostic accuracy across the range of test values. It equals 1.0 for perfect accuracy and 0.5 when the curve corresponds to random chance. Thus, the closer the area is to 1.0, the more accurate the test. From a meta-analysis of multiple studies, the standard exercise test cut point of 0.1 mV (1 mm) of horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression has been selected as the discriminating cut point and has a sensitivity of 68% and specificity of 77%.\n\n Assessment of Anatomic and Functional Extent of CAD\n\nExercise-induced ST-segment depression does not provide a reliable assessment of the specific coronary vessel(s) involved. However, ST-segment elevation in leads without Q waves, though an uncommon response, usually reflects transmural ischemia that can be localized by the leads involved: Leads V2 through V4 reflect left anterior descending artery disease; lateral leads reflect left circumflex and diagonal vessel disease; and leads II, III, and aVF\n---\n Fletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 889\n\nreflect right CAD (in a right dominant circulation). 58 As noted doses that increase every 3 minutes until a maximal dose is previously, other factors related to the probability and severity of CAD include the degree, time of appearance, duration, and number of leads with ST-segment depression or elevation. It is important, however, to realize that prognostically important CAD can be present without significant luminal obstructive lesions, particularly in the presence of endothelial dysfunction and unstable but nonobstructive plaque. 165 Hence, the use of diagnostic ST-segment analysis alone during exercise testing is inadequate and should be done with consideration of several non\u2013ST-segment variables, as discussed in the later section on prognosis.\n\nThe primary end point with dobutamine testing is a target HR of 85% of the age-predicted maximal value, in the absence of higher-grade arrhythmia, angina, intolerable side effects, and significant increase or decrease in blood pressure.

Imaging provides information on the location and amount of ischemic myocardium and on LV function. Exercise or pharmacological stress imaging studies are useful particularly when the resting ECG has baseline abnormalities (eg, left bundle-branch block or resting ST depression >1 mm) that limit the accurate interpretation of the exercise ECG or when the results of the exercise ECG are equivocal or indeterminate.\n\nThe Ischemic Cascade The limitation of coronary flow reserve by hemodynamically \u201csignificant\u201d stenoses leads to a mismatch between myocardial oxygen supply and demand during stress. The acute metabolic consequences of this mismatch include decreased production of adenosine triphosphate and increased production of lactate, and they result in alterations of the electrical properties and mechanical function of the myocardium. These alterations occur in rapid succession in a characteristic sequence termed ischemic cascade and include, in typical order, reduced LV compliance, regional wall motion abnormalities attributable to decreased myocardial contractility, increased LV end-diastolic pressure, and ST-segment changes exceeding the usual threshold of 0.1 mV. 166 The clinical symptom of angina pectoris often occurs last, if at all.\n\nStress Imaging Modalities and Exercise Testing Selective A2a Adenosine Receptor Agonists and Adenosine Vasodilators such as adenosine, dipyridamole, and regadenoson cause coronary vasodilation in normal epicardial arteries. 168,169 Because of autoregulation, coronary arteries with metabolically significant stenoses already recruit vasodilator reserve at rest to maintain coronary flow; therefore, they cannot increase coronary flow as much as coronary arteries without stenoses when vasodilators are given. The relative lack of increased perfusion during vasodilation can be visualized with nuclear myocardial perfusion agents. Vasodilator stress agents are not commonly used for stress echocardiography in the United States, where dobutamine may serve as an alternative to exercise.\n\nNuclear perfusion imaging with vasodilator agents is useful particularly for the diagnosis of CAD in patients with left bundle-branch block on resting ECG, 168 because artifactual perfusion defects can occur in patients with normal coronary arteries and left bundle-branch block with exercise or dobutamine stress. Side effects of vasodilator agents include flushing, chest pain, headache, nausea, dyspnea, and AV block,168 which can be reversed with aminophylline. Because of the short half-life of adenosine, side effects usually resolve very shortly after termination of the infusion. Adenosine and dipyridamole should not be used in patients with second- or third-degree block who do not have permanent pacemakers in place or in patients with severe asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease. 168 Because caffeine can block the effects of adenosine and the A2a receptor agonists, patients should refrain from consuming caffeine for 24 hours before the test.\n\nNuclear Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress myocardial perfusion imaging can be performed as 168 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)170 or positron emission tomography (PET).

Adrenergic agents such as dobutamine increase myocardial oxygen demand by increasing myocardial contractility, HR, and blood pressure.

Nonetheless, cumulative radiation is a factor in serial perfusion imaging.\n\nSPECT and N-13 ammonia PET can be performed with exercise and pharmacological stress, whereas R-82 PET imaging can be performed only with pharmacological stress because of the extremely short tracer half-life. The radioisotope is injected, and scanning is performed at rest and, depending on the approach, immediately after exercise or 1 to 2 minutes before the end of the stress agent infusion. Myocardial perfusion images at rest and during stress are displayed as tomographic slices in 3 different views to visualize all myocardial segments without overlap. Perfusion defects that are present during exercise but not at rest indicate myocardial ischemia. Perfusion defects that are present during exercise and persist at rest suggest previous MI.\n\nThe sensitivity of exercise SPECT, vasodilator SPECT, and PET approaches to nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging for detecting coronary artery stenoses \u226550% range from 87% to 90%, with corresponding specificities of 73% to 89%.\n\n Echocardiography\n\nWith exercise stress, echocardiographic images in several views are obtained with electrocardiographic gating (ie, synchronized to the QRS complex) at rest and while the patient performs stationary cycling or immediately after treadmill exercise. Images must be obtained within 1 to 2 minutes (preferably <1 minute) after exercise because inducible regional wall motion abnormalities resolve rapidly after stress. With pharmacological stress, images are obtained at baseline, with low-dose and peak dobutamine infusion, and during recovery. Echocardiography by itself has no known risks, and serial testing has no known cumulative effects.\n\nThe images obtained during different phases of the stress test are compared side by side.

Recent developments have\n\nPrognosis and Diagnosis\n\nPrognostic Value of the Exercise ECG\n\nIn addition to its role in the diagnosis of CAD, exercise electrocardiographic testing provides a standardized method to gauge prognosis regardless of whether CAD is present. In fact, although reliance on exercise testing for CAD diagnosis increasingly is challenged by alternative diagnostic strategies (eg, imaging modalities, serologic markers), application of exercise electrocardiographic testing to assess prognosis is increasing 3,183 and often serves as a complementary perspective for management decisions. 3,184\n\nPrognostic Value of Exercise Capacity\n\nExercise capacity, or the amount of work achieved before exhaustion, is the most powerful predictor of survival. Multiple studies have specifically demonstrated the utility of exercise\n---\n 71,74,185 Fletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 891\n\ncapacity testing to gauge prognosis. The longer and more of cut points of &lt;5 METs in women and &lt;7 METs in men, it is more logical and accurate to assess each individual relative to age- and sex-based standards. Still, even this stratification is only an approximation because differences in height, weight, and mode of exercise all modify exercise potential and ideally should be incorporated into stratifications of age and sex standards. Others have demonstrated the differences between formulas that have been developed to approximate \"normal standards of oxygen utilization\" against which peak Vo\u03072 measured during CPX can be compared; these so-called \"normal\" values vary considerably between well-validated formulas depending on which patient traits were included or omitted for each calculated value of Vo\u03072.\n\nAbnormal Chronotropic Response to Exercise Chronotropic incompetence is the inability of the HR to increase commensurate with increased activity or demand. An intact HR response is vital for matching cardiac output to metabolic demands during exertion. Investigations in population-based and clinical cohorts demonstrated that an impaired chronotropic response is predictive of cardiac events and all-cause death. Despite such specific theoretical value, definition of chronotropic response often remains relatively ambiguous. The simplest approach is to report change in HR with exercise relative to peak HR. Because peak HR decreases with age, age-predicted maximal HR is often determined as 220 minus age in years. An inability to achieve \u226585% of age-predicted maximum HR has been considered chronotropic incompetence. However, baseline functional capacity and resting HR also have bearing on chronotropic responses. Therefore, an alternative method to determine chronotropic incompetence entails assessment of the proportion of HR reserve used at peak exercise, defined by the difference between age-predicted maximal HR and resting HR. The difference is divided by the observed HR reserve to determine the proportion of HR reserve used. This value is often referred to as the chronotropic index or the proportion of HR reserve used during exercise.

Numerous investigations have demonstrated that a predict death than ectopy originating from the right ventricular outflow tract or other relatively benign variants. 201 Prognostic Value of Exercise Imaging The literature focused on prognostic value of exercise electrocardiographic testing is evolving in parallel with a separate literature focused on prognostic value of imaging variables during exercise and pharmacological stress testing. Advantages of imaging include the opportunity to characterize ejection fraction, extent and distribution of ischemia, presence of coronary calcification, and, in some cases, even the intrinsic structure of stenoses, all of which are powerful risk predictors for both death and cardiovascular events. These indices are generally recommended to complement but not replace standard exercise prognostic electrocardiographic testing. 181\n\nNonetheless, the magnitude of HR recovery is a strong adverse prognostic marker in both apparently healthy and patient populations, irrespective of differences in patient populations, medications, or baseline functional capacity. 12\u201317,194\n\nExercise capacity remains an important predictor of outcomes even when SPECT imaging is available, and relatively little but additional prognostic insight is gained by adding SPECT imaging findings in those with \u226510 METs of exercise capacity. 202 In another study, when treadmill test capacity exceeded 9 minutes, myocardial perfusion findings added little to the already favorable determination of risk. 203\n\nIn contrast, imaging 204 adds value in patients who cannot exercise with sufficient intensity to determine risk by exercise alone. Adults who are older, deconditioned, female, or overweight are among those for whom imaging improves prognostic assessment. 205 It remains relatively difficult to determine when pharmacological stress should be substituted for exercise stress to determine prognosis in situations in which exercise performance might be low. It would seem physiologically and diagnostically confounding to convert exercise to pharmacological stress when angina or potential angina equivalent occurs as a limiting symptom in patients with subthreshold HR.\n\nPrognostic Exercise Test Scores The Duke Treadmill Score was introduced in 1991 as a set of treadmill exercise findings that predict individual risk for death on the basis of a weighted combination of exercise duration, ST-segment depression, and the presence and nature of angina during testing. 210 The score is calculated by subtracting 5 times the ST depression (in millimeters) and 4 times the angina score (no angina = 0, nonlimiting angina = 1, and test-limiting angina = 2) from minutes of exercise duration on the standard Bruce protocol. The component of the Duke Treadmill Score that has been consistently validated for independent prognostic utility is exercise capacity; independent prognostic utility of angina and even of exercise-induced ST-segment changes is less certain. 196,211\n\nThe concept of the exercise testing score has evolved through identification, generally by logistic regression, of a broader spectrum of clinical and exercise testing variables that can be used as a multivariate score to predict risk.

Exercise-induced hypotension consistently has been shown to be a marker of increased risk for adverse events. Occasionally, subjects without clinically significant heart disease will exhibit exercise-induced hypotension related to dehydration, inappropriate titration of antihypertensive therapy, or prolonged strenuous exercise.\n\nAn exaggerated systolic blood pressure response to exercise has been defined as a maximal value of \u2265210 mmHg for men and \u2265190 mmHg for women. A rise in diastolic blood pressure during exercise of >10 mm Hg above the resting value or an absolute value of 90 mmHg also is considered abnormal and could predict increased likelihood of CAD. Recommended relative indications for exercise test termination are a systolic or diastolic blood pressure of >250 and >115 mm Hg, respectively. 58 An exaggerated systolic blood pressure response to exercise could indicate an increased risk for future hypertension, LV hypertrophy, and cardiovascular events. 197 A failure of systolic blood pressure to fall or a rise in the short-term recovery period, relative to the maximal exercise value, has been shown to be predictive of an increased risk of death. 199\n\nArrhythmias During Exercise and Recovery The literature on ventricular ectopy during exercise or in recovery has been inconsistent. Some reports indicate that ventricular ectopy during exercise testing heralds increased risk of death, 145 whereas others do not. Other studies indicate increased risk of death in those demonstrating increased ventricular ectopy in recovery. 200 One report focuses more specifically on origin of the ventricular ectopy, indicating that ectopy with a right bundle-branch block morphology, often associated with significant LV dysfunction, was more likely to ectopy with a right bundle-branch block morphology, often associated with significant LV dysfunction, was more likely to\n---\nexercise capacity, HR dynamics, ventricular ectopy, and other Functional Classification of Disability Exercise testing is used to determine the degree of disability in subjects with various forms of heart and vascular disease, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, congenital heart disease, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Failure to achieve a 5-MET capacity when aerobic capacity is estimated from workload and failure to reach 15.0 mL kg -1 min -1 when aerobic capacity is measured directly by CPX have been used as criteria for disability by the Social Security Administration.\n\nEvaluation of Perioperative Risk for Noncardiac Surgery In most ambulatory patients, exercise testing with electrocardiographic monitoring provides both an estimate of functional capacity and the detection of myocardial ischemia through changes in the ECG and hemodynamic response.

Although there is evidence that the development of an ischemic electrocardiographic response at low workloads of testing among asymptomatic men is associated with a higher relative risk of future events such as angina pectoris, MI, and sudden death, the absolute risk of cardiac events in these populations remains low. As a consequence, the predictive value of any test in low-risk populations must be low. It is also acknowledged that prospective, multicenter studies to demonstrate that interventions based on exercise electrocardiographic findings alone can favorably alter clinical outcomes in asymptomatic subjects are wanting.\n\nEven so, several exercise electrocardiographic findings have been related to future risk and have potential importance for risk management. In a study that used the Ellestad protocol in asymptomatic men and women with known CAD, electrocardiographic ischemic changes and an exercise duration \u22645 minutes correlated with subsequent events in men >40 years of age, but it was concluded that the exercise ECG had limited value in women and in men \u226440 years of age. A study in 6100 asymptomatic men who were free of clinically detectable CVD revealed that the occurrence of frequent premature ventricular depolarizations during exercise testing was associated with a long-term (25-year) increase in the risk of\n\nAdditional Uses of Exercise Testing Exercise Prescription Although the indications for exercise testing are varied, the assessment of exercise response and determination of functional capacity are particularly useful in the development of the exercise plan or prescription. Furthermore, in recording the exercise response to various levels of intensity, the exercise test can also serve to identify inappropriate or abnormal signs or symptoms, which are useful in the evaluation of safety of exercise programming. These findings determine the limitations or contraindications to higher exercise intensities or types of exercise programming, although this applies primarily to patients with structural heart disease rather than to the healthy population. The exercise test provides for the appropriate training intensity prescription by setting targets for HR reserve (40%\u201380% of peak), Vo \u03072 reserve (40%\u201380% of peak), percent of peak exercise HR achieved (65%\u201380%), and RPE (11\u201316 on a 6-to-20 Borg scale).\n\nAssessment of Therapeutic Response Response to Exercise Training The response to exercise training can be evaluated with the exercise test in determining potential changes in peak Vo2 (functional capacity), cardiovascular and perceptual responses to submaximal exercise, and in patients with heart disease symptomatology. Ideally, expected improvement in these indices would include increased peak Vo2 and reduced HR, systolic blood pressure, and RPE at standardized submaximal exercise intensities. In addition, training results in increased exercise time and workload to provocation of symptoms previously identified during submaximal exercise, such as angina pectoris, exaggerated dyspnea, or undue fatigue. Measurable improvements, or lack thereof, provide the basis for updates in the exercise prescription and determination of subsequent strategies for patient care.\n\nResponse to Medication Management of medication prescribed to control exercise-related symptoms or various inappropriate cardiorespiratory responses also can be evaluated with exercise testing. Determination of abnormal signs or symptoms such as angina pectoris, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and the associated various levels of exercise intensity in which these occur, can be evaluated. Ideally, expected improvement in such indices during exercise would include elimination of abnormal signs/symptoms, prolongation of time to occurrence of signs/symptoms, or increased submaximal exercise intensity associated with these signs/symptoms, as examples.\n---\n 894 Circulation August 20, 2013\n\ndeath from cardiovascular causes; no significant increase in of asymptomatic low-risk younger individuals is not recommended, but they do recommend exercise testing before starting a vigorous exercise program in asymptomatic people with diabetes mellitus, in men and women >45 and 55 years of age, respectively, and in those with \u201cmajor coronary risk factors.\u201d These standards are in accord with recommendations based on the following considerations.", "start_char_idx": 37034, "end_char_idx": 42469, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17834ce6-6ee4-4fbd-8c88-a5b50f7127ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "17834ce6-6ee4-4fbd-8c88-a5b50f7127ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "662b6283efdeaeacedfe39cf93b00e29fc39f207504b3937e500aca9e46054db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "35cb0af6-f348-412e-af81-043065d3ecf1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "9246398d44c8f1504db1aabfddfb9d8d49351fd03439eed863f72beedfa2785e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "03843e70-bd4e-47f5-a4b6-6f474a4c41f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "f16ca37cf73fbfb5d0f5610236a3ab87ddfceb4bc0cb5dc748f4e7c7ab890c38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Determination of abnormal signs or symptoms such as angina pectoris, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and the associated various levels of exercise intensity in which these occur, can be evaluated.

Most acute cardiac events are attributable to plaque rupture of minor stenoses that are not likely themselves to be obstructive and therefore would not be directly identified by exercise testing. Although extensive obstruction makes unstable plaque more likely and might be more readily identified by exercise testing, it is not highly prevalent in asymptomatic people at low risk for CAD.\n\nPrediction of exercise-related MI and sudden death by exercise testing is therefore limited by the same factors that reduce exercise test diagnostic performance in asymptomatic adults: positive predictive value is very low and false-positive tests are highly prevalent when event rates are low, and test specificity is imperfect. On the basis of these considerations, the present standards do not recommend routine exercise testing for prediction of infarction or sudden death during exercise in asymptomatic low-risk younger subjects. However, there are reasons for exercise testing before starting a vigorous exercise program in selected asymptomatic subjects that are not related to risk prediction for acute infarction or sudden death. A positive exercise test might be useful in intensifying risk factor management, particularly when functional test findings such as chronotropic incompetence, reduced HR recovery, limited effort capacity, or blood pressure abnormalities suggest increased risk of all-cause death. Furthermore, asymptomatic patients at higher risk for obstructive CAD could benefit from the reassurance provided by a normal test, which might facilitate prescription of and compliance with more vigorous exercise. Exercise-related arrhythmias, abnormal blood pressure responses, or ischemic electrocardiographic changes in otherwise asymptomatic patients at higher risk can provide insight into limited effort capacity. Exercise testing is recommended before vigorous exercise or competitive athletics in individuals with chest pain or with dyspnea on exertion, with or without known CAD, to evaluate whether vigorous exercise is appropriate for such an individual, to establish training limits, and to develop an exercise prescription.\n\nExercise stress testing can also be recommended before vigorous exercise in high-risk asymptomatic individuals who are classified as CAD equivalents by the National Cholesterol Education Program. This includes those with diabetes mellitus, symptomatic carotid disease, peripheral vascular disease, and a calculated Framingham 10-year risk of \u226520%.\n\nExercise Electrocardiographic Testing in Women\n\nExercise testing has similar diagnostic and prognostic value in women as it does for men.

However, individual risk of adverse events is reduced in conditioned subjects, and thus routine exercise is strongly encouraged for people with and without established heart disease.

Although overall prognosis in these women is better than in those with obstructive coronary disease, syndrome X is nonetheless associated with an increased rate of cardiovascular mortality, including sudden cardiac death, MI, and heart failure. 256\u2013259\n\nIt is possible that stress tests that are deemed false-positives because of subsequent normal coronary angiography actually represent a population of women with cardiac syndrome X. Further studies are needed to evaluate women with a false-positive exercise ECG but persistent chest pain to pursue the diagnosis of cardiac syndrome X.\n\n The Pediatric Population\n\nThe acquisition of exercise test data in pediatric patients requires special considerations and accommodations. Appropriate-sized or adjustable equipment (eg, cycle ergometers, blood pressure cuffs, mouthpieces) are needed. It is also sometimes necessary to modify protocols. Low ramp rates are needed for small children performing cycle ergometry. The speed required for the higher levels of the Bruce protocol could be too rapid for small patients. In contrast, for many relatively healthy adolescent subjects, the lower stages of the Bruce protocol might seem tedious and are unlikely to yield any useful clinical information.\n\nInterpretation of exercise test data in pediatric subjects also can be challenging. Peak Vo \u03072 and related variables vary with age, size, and (especially after puberty) sex. Proper interpretation of data therefore generally relies on prediction equations, generated from a population of normal subjects, which take these factors into account. In pediatrics, the most widely used prediction equations are the height-based equations (which rely on height rather than weight to avoid the potential confounding effects of adiposity/obesity). 261 The limitations of these prediction equations must, however, be considered. They tend to generate unrealistically low values for small children, especially boys. Hence, for subjects <130 cm tall, it is probably best to calculate the predicted peak Vo \u03072 on the basis of data indicating that the peak Vo \u03072 of an average prepubescent boy is 42 mL kg\u22121min\u22121 and that of an average prepubescent girl is 38 mL kg\u22121 min\u22121.262 The patient\u2019s ideal weight-for-height should be used in these calculations. For patients with an unusually tall and thin body habitus (body mass index [BMI] <18 kg/m2), the height-based prediction equations generate unphysiologically high values, and the weight-based prediction equations should be used. 20 Whichever equations are chosen by a laboratory, the validity of the predictions for the population served by the laboratory should be established by testing several normal subjects and confirming that the predicted values agree well with the results of these tests. 56\n---\n 896 Circulation August 20, 2013\n\nabnormalities and ST abnormalities) and exercise-induced ST associated with the age-related decline in maximal HR. 3 As a changes unrelated to myocardial ischemia are common among pediatric cardiology patients.

An exercise test with pre- and postexercise spirometry might be a worthwhile study if this condition is suspected. For patients with congenital heart defects, the primary purpose of an exercise test is usually to assess the patient\u2019s exercise capacity and cardiopulmonary response to exercise. Measurements at peak exercise are particularly helpful in this regard. However, for peak exercise data to be reliable and reproducible, it is important to ascertain that the patient expends a maximal or near-maximal effort. Exercise laboratory personnel should therefore be familiar with effective techniques for motivating children to expend adequate efforts. During CPX testing, patients should be encouraged to continue exercising until the respiratory exchange ratio exceeds 1.09. In prepubescent children, anaerobic metabolic pathways might not be expressed to the extent seen in older individuals, and a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.05 could be sufficient. 267 Reliance on the peak HR as a marker of effort expenditure often is not possible, as many patients with congenital heart disease have chronotropic defects and cannot achieve normal peak HRs. 268 Exercise test data also can be helpful in the management of pediatric patients with arrhythmias. In general, exacerbation or precipitation of arrhythmias during exercise is associated with an increased risk for serious adverse events.

For either treadmill or cycle ergometry, some laboratories use a ramp protocol with small, almost imperceptible increments of work rate every minute or less. Regardless of the exercise modality or specific protocol, adequate time should be allowed to familiarize the older patient with the testing equipment and to provide a 1- to 2-minute warm-up period. These pretest maneuvers will help alleviate the anxiety of the older patient and reduce the risk of musculoskeletal injury and falls.\n\nDespite the greater prevalence and severity of CAD with age, exercise testing remains as safe a procedure in the elderly as in younger populations with proper techniques and monitoring. National surveys of exercise laboratories have documented very low overall risks of MI or cardiac death, and age has not been identified as a risk factor for these events. However, age-associated increases in isolated ectopic beats and nonsustained supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, even in clinically asymptomatic subjects, have been observed. The supervising clinician should be aware that myocardial ischemia or MI in the older adult can present as marked dyspnea, extreme fatigue, or chest pressure, rather than as typical chest discomfort or pain.\n\nExercise testing is well established as a useful tool for assessing the progress of patients with stable CAD and those who have had MI. Available data in the older adult, although more limited, suggest similar prognostic value in this age group. As in the general post-MI population, inability to perform treadmill exercise after MI confers a high risk for future death. In 111 infarct survivors >64 years of age, one group observed a 1-year mortality rate of 37% in the 63 patients not eligible for exercise testing, versus only 4% in those able to exercise. In the latter group, 1-year mortality rate was best predicted by the magnitude of systolic blood pressure rise during exercise; the mortality rate was 15% in patients with an increase <30 mmHg versus 1.8% in those with an increase >30 mmHg. The prognostic importance of systolic blood pressure response to exercise was confirmed in 188 post-MI patients >70 years of age. In this latter study, peak cycle work rate <60 W, exercise duration <5 minutes, and increase in rate\u2013pressure product <12 also predicted increased cardiovascular death. In contrast, ST-segment depression and ventricular arrhythmia predicted recurrent MI and need for coronary revascularization but not death.\n\nIn older patients with stable CAD, exercise testing also has diagnostic and prognostic utility. In 419 CAD patients >65 years of age, one study revealed that severe ST-segment depression induced by cycle ergometry predicted triple-vessel disease. Ischemic ST-segment depression predicted an increased risk of cardiac death in another study of older patients with stable CAD. Although not recommended for routine use in apparently healthy older adults, exercise testing has also demonstrated prognostic significance in such a population. Although information about the utility of exercise testing among individuals >75 years of age is limited, available data suggest similar value to that in younger elders, a possible exception being concentration of risk by the Duke treadmill score. In 5314 male veterans 65 to 92 years of age undergoing clinically indicated exercise testing, each 1-MET greater exercise capacity was associated with a 12% lower risk of death over 8 years of median follow-up. In the subset of 2754 men >70 years of age (mean 75.3 years), a similar trend was seen; men achieving 5 to 6 METs had a 45% lower mortality rate than those attaining <4 METs.

This confirmed data in a series of 335 octogenarians in whom LV wall motion score stratified patients into low- and high-risk groups with annualized event rates of 1.2% and 5.8% per year, and an earlier study of patients whose mean age was 72 years. Exercise radionuclide imaging has also shown prognostic utility in this age group. The use of exercise testing for risk stratification, exercise prescription, and assessment of therapeutic intervention in this \u201colder old\u201d population will continue to increase with changing demographics.\n\nHypertension\n\nHypertension per se is not an indication for exercise testing, but it is very often present in individuals who are referred for testing. The test should be postponed if resting systolic blood pressure exceeds 200 mmHg or if diastolic exceeds 115 mmHg. Antihypertensive medications generally should not be withheld before testing. Hypertensive individuals often have an exaggerated pressure response to exercise even if resting levels are controlled. A systolic pressure >250 mmHg or a diastolic pressure >115 mmHg during exercise is an indication for test termination, although there is little clinical evidence that this actually leads to cerebrovascular events during testing. Several studies have related impaired diastolic function to reduced aerobic capacity in people with hypertension and normal systolic LV function. Among 6578 asymptomatic participants in the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study, a pressure >180/90 mmHg during stage 2 of the Bruce exercise protocol was associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular death in normotensive individuals but not in those with hypertension. Maximal exercise blood pressure was not predictive in normotensive or hypertensive individuals after adjustment for resting pressure. Reduced exercise capacity is a strong predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in otherwise healthy people with hypertension, as is true in normotensive individuals.\n\nObesity\n\nExercise testing is useful in the clinical evaluation of obese patients with known or suspected CAD. However, obtaining an accurate assessment of peak cardiopulmonary responses\n---\n Diabetes Mellitus\n\nBecause diabetes mellitus is a potent risk factor for CAD, exercise testing can be useful both in screening for CAD in asymptomatic individuals who have diabetes mellitus and in assessing prognosis. Asymptomatic individuals who have diabetes mellitus generally show reduced aerobic capacity relative to nondiabetic age-matched peers, as well as a reduced chronotropic response, likely because of autonomic dysfunction.\n\nAmong 1341 patients with diabetes mellitus referred for exercise testing, 36% had an impaired chronotropic response, defined by achievement of <80% of predicted HR reserve. Such individuals were at increased risk for total mortality, MI, and coronary revascularization procedures, independent of conventional risk factors. Although a blunted chronotropic response to treadmill exercise is observed in patients who have diabetes mellitus and without evident cardiac autonomic neuropathy, this chronotropic impairment is greater among those with neuropathy. Reduced HR recovery has also been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause death in diabetic populations. Multiple studies have reported an inverse relationship between exercise capacity and mortality rate in individuals who have diabetes mellitus as in individuals who do not have diabetes mellitus. In a study of 2867 male veterans with diabetes mellitus referred for exercise testing, each 1-MET lower exercise capacity was associated with an 18% higher risk of death over a mean follow-up of 7.8 years, independent of conventional risk factors. Although screening of asymptomatic patients who have diabetes mellitus with exercise ECG or pharmacological myocardial perfusion imaging could identify substantial numbers of individuals with inducible myocardial ischemia, the recent Detection of Ischemia in Asymptomatic Diabetics (DIAD) and Do You Need to Assess Myocardial Ischemia in Type-2 diabetes (DYNAMIT) trials showed no significant benefit of such screening on hard clinical outcomes.

In accord with Bayesian principles, the greatest incremental diagnostic value occurs in intermediate-risk clinical patient subsets. Exercise treadmill testing should be considered in patients who present to the ED with symptoms such as chest discomfort when they are classified as \u201clow risk,\u201d which includes the following: Two sets of cardiac enzymes at 4-hour intervals are normal; ECG at the time of presentation and before the exercise test shows no significant changes; the resting ECG has no abnormalities that preclude accurate assessment of the exercise ECG; and the patient is asymptomatic or has minimal atypical chest pain from admission to the time results are available from the second enzyme set. Early exercise testing has been applied in patients with chest pain who are identified as low risk by clinical assessment, which has been implemented by using 2 approaches. In most studies, it is performed soon after presentation after an acute coronary syndrome has been excluded. Acute coronary syndromes are ruled out by an accelerated diagnostic protocol, which is usually performed within a 6- to 12-hour interval with serial cardiac serum markers and ECGs. In the second, less common, strategy, selected low-risk patients undergo \u201cimmediate\u201d exercise testing to stratify the group into those who can be discharged directly from the ED and those who require admission. Both methods have thus far been shown to be safe, informative, and cost-effective, although experience with the latter is considerably more limited than with the former.\n\n Known or Suspected Arrhythmias\n\nComprehensive ACCF/AHA/European Society of Cardiology guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias were published in 2006. Class I recommendations for exercise testing include adult patients with ventricular arrhythmias who have an intermediate or greater probability of having coronary disease and patients (regardless of age) with known or suspected exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, for provocation, to make a diagnosis, and to evaluate the response to tachycardia. Exercise testing is considered useful, Class IIa, for evaluating the response to medical or ablation treatment in patients with known exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias. Class IIb recommendations include patients with arrhythmias but a low probability of CAD and for the evaluation of isolated ventricular premature beats in greater than middle-aged patients without other evidence of CAD. In a scientific statement on risk for sudden cardiac death, assessment of functional capacity by peak oxygen consumption and by the 6-minute walk test was considered more accurate than clinical variables such as functional classification for the prediction of death and sudden death in chronic heart failure. The application of other available guidelines to exercise testing in patients with known or suspected arrhythmias but nonatherosclerotic heart diseases was recently reviewed by Morise. Specifically considered were hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, documented VT, pacemakers, and T-wave alternans. Class I indications for exercise testing include the assessment of HR-adaptive pacemakers and individuals with congenital complete heart block who are contemplating increased physical activity or competitive sports. Class IIa indications include arrhythmia provocation in patients with known or suspected exercise-induced arrhythmias, including evaluation of medical, surgical, or catheter ablation therapy in such individuals; evaluation of ventricular rate response and suspected myocardial ischemia in patients with atrial fibrillation; and in combination with T-wave alternans testing in patients with or at risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.", "start_char_idx": 63133, "end_char_idx": 68396, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a186ed6a-22c9-422b-9c01-9cbd9121ab6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a186ed6a-22c9-422b-9c01-9cbd9121ab6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "662b6283efdeaeacedfe39cf93b00e29fc39f207504b3937e500aca9e46054db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e148e6e2-a524-4f37-b591-fb7638b81cc6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "c066a3333170d77cc2452fb5333e33d42848dc946682aeb7df700c6eca22b54d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6dc5ccb0-d4bb-49e9-89db-72f68584e97e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "b48125fe1bb88b982c5dff6143d2ab6e119c47e16521c6bd74ae87800b97824f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The application of other available guidelines to exercise testing in patients with known or suspected arrhythmias but nonatherosclerotic heart diseases was recently reviewed by Morise.

Adult Congenital Heart Disease Adults with congenital heart disease usually have cardiovas- cular issues that are distinct from those encountered among other adult cardiology patients. The role of exercise testing in the assessment and management of this unique group there- fore differs substantially from that associated with typical adult cardiology patients. In general, the primary goal of exer- cise testing in adults with congenital heart disease is not the detection or evaluation of CAD. Rather, purposes of the test include the following:\n\n- Assessment of the patient\u2019s exercise capacity\n- Identification of factors that limit exercise performance\n- Derivation of information on risk of cardiovascular and all- cause death\n- Objective determination, based on serial testing, of whether there has been a change in clinical status or exercise capacity\n- Assessment of the impact of therapeutic interventions on exercise function\n\nIn patients with rate-adaptive pacemakers, exercise testing can help to optimize the HR response and increase exercise capacity. Such testing can be especially useful in patients whose exercise intolerance is not improved by pacing or empirical pacemaker adjustments. Patients with atrial fibrillation not uncommonly demon- strate exaggerated ventricular rate responses to low-level exer- cise even when resting HR appears well controlled. Exercise testing can identify such individuals and can be used to titrate ventricular rate response through medication adjustment to optimize exercise capacity. Exercise testing also can detect QRS widening after initiating Class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nHeart Failure CPX is now a well-established clinical assessment procedure in patients with heart failure. Although the general approach to exercise testing in the heart failure population is similar to other groups, selection of the optimal testing protocol for the individual patient warrants special consideration.

Other ventilatory expired gas and traditional exercise test variables have also demonstrated additive prognostic value through multivari- ate modeling, although additional research is needed before solidifying recommendations for clinical practice.\n\nPulmonary Hypertension The role of CPX in assessing pulmonary hemodynamics is a rapidly emerging field demonstrating a great deal of clinical promise. Patients diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension typically present with a level of diminished aerobic capacity, correlating with disease severity. Perhaps more importantly, measures of ventilatory efficiency, specifically the Ve/Vco\u0307 2 slope or ratio and the partial pressure of end-tidal CO 2 during exercise, reflect the degree of elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure and therefore disease severity. Numerous studies and a meta-analysis have shown low posi- tive predictive value but high negative predictive value for such testing in predicting these arrhythmias. Thus, a neg- ative test is reassuring, whereas a positive test suggests that further risk stratification is needed.\n---\n Fletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 901\n\nIf a patient with adult congenital heart disease has impaired exercise performance, it is helpful to determine whether the impairment is likely attributable to an impaired chronotropic response, reflected by a depressed peak HR, or an impaired stroke volume response, reflected by a low oxygen pulse at peak exercise. It also should be noted that in the presence of significant chronotropic impairment there should be a compensatory increase in stroke volume and oxygen pulse, solely on the basis of the Frank-Starling mechanism. Under these circumstances, an oxygen pulse at peak exercise that is \u201conly normal\u201d is, in fact, abnormal. 20\n\nData acquired at submaximal exercise (eg, the ventilatory threshold and the Ve/Vco2 slope) have also been found to be useful in patients with congenital heart disease. In general, the prognostic value of ventilatory threshold data is similar to but less well established than Vo2max data. In patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot, the Ve/Vco2 slope has been found to be a sensitive predictor of death. 352 In these patients, the elevated Ve/Vco2 slope is probably due, at least in part, to pulmonary blood flow maldistribution secondary to pulmonary artery stenoses. 355 These stenoses can have a particularly deleterious effect on the physiology of the postoperative tetralogy patient and a strong, negative impact on prognosis. Effective relief of these stenoses has been found to improve exercise capacity and the Ve/Vco2 slope. An elevated Ve/Vco2 slope has also been associated with an increased risk of death in patients with atrial repairs of transposition of the great arteries. 353 In these patients, the elevated Ve/Vco2 slope can arise (as it does in patients with heart failure) secondary to pulmonary blood flow maldistribution and ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch, which in turn develop as a result of the elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure associated with the progressive systemic (right) ventricular dysfunction often encountered in these patients as they age.\n\nRight-to-left shunting also increases the Ve/Vco2 slope, probably as a consequence of the shunting of hypercapnic venous blood into the systemic circulation. Elimination of a right-to-left shunt almost invariably reduces the Ve/Vco2 slope. An elevated Ve/Vco2 slope has also been associated with increased risk of death in mixed cohorts of patients with a variety of congenital heart diseases. 358,359 However, it has not been shown to be associated with increased risk of death in patients with Fontan circulations.", "start_char_idx": 71551, "end_char_idx": 76491, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04c5043a-3f93-486d-b49d-36ba3eaf6600": {"__data__": {"id_": "04c5043a-3f93-486d-b49d-36ba3eaf6600", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "662b6283efdeaeacedfe39cf93b00e29fc39f207504b3937e500aca9e46054db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6dc5ccb0-d4bb-49e9-89db-72f68584e97e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "b48125fe1bb88b982c5dff6143d2ab6e119c47e16521c6bd74ae87800b97824f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa457cd7-d1c7-4625-8637-88e1b6d44034", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "965ad1a7d483d2e85e17744474626430fdbf3890feb976ebd20b93e7cb39f179", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "353 In these patients, the elevated Ve/Vco2 slope can arise (as it does in patients with heart failure) secondary to pulmonary blood flow maldistribution and ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch, which in turn develop as a result of the elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure associated with the progressive systemic (right) ventricular dysfunction often encountered in these patients as they age.\n\nRight-to-left shunting also increases the Ve/Vco2 slope, probably as a consequence of the shunting of hypercapnic venous blood into the systemic circulation.

The abnormal pressure response appears to be mediated by a decrease in stroke volume attributable to systolic dysfunction.\n\nAlthough nonsustained VT (NSVT) during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with HCM, the role of exercise-induced NSVT in predicting adverse outcomes is less clear. In a cohort of 1380 such patients referred to a cardiomyopathy clinic, 27 (2%) developed NSVT (n=24) or ventricular fibrillation (n=3) during exercise testing. These individuals had more severe septal hypertrophy and larger left atria than those without such arrhythmias. On multivariate analysis, however, the combination of NSVT and ventricular fibrillation, but not NSVT alone, was associated with an increased risk of sudden death (hazard ratio = 3.1) over a mean follow-up of 54 months. 360\n\nExercise echocardiography can be useful in eliciting a hemodynamically significant LVOT gradient in patients with HCM with no or minimal gradient at rest. In 1 study of 256 patients with resting LVOT gradients <30 mmHg, 52% developed a significant gradient (80\u00b143 mmHg) with exercise. Only 40% of these latter individuals developed a gradient >30 mmHg with Valsalva. 361 Whether these patients with high LVOT gradients provocable only with exercise share a similar increased risk of adverse outcomes as those with resting gradients remains unclear.\n\nThe safety of exercise testing in patients with HCM has been demonstrated in several studies, some of which were discussed previously in this document. In >3000 such patients tested over 10 years, the only serious event was a single case of sustained VT, successfully terminated by cardioversion. 362 In another report, only one episode of sustained VT occurred with exercise in 263 patients, and no patients experienced syncope. 363 Thus, exercise testing appears safe and might be useful in identifying HCM patients with no or minor resting LVOT gradients who could be at higher risk because of a provocable gradient or ventricular tachyarrhythmia during exercise.\n\nCardiac Transplantation\n\nDuring maximal treadmill or cycle ergometer testing, cardiac transplant recipients demonstrate lower-than-predicted peak HR, systolic blood pressure, Vo2, exercise time, stroke volume, and cardiac output and increased ventilatory equivalent. The reduced stroke volume is secondary to blunting of preload reserve, the end-diastolic volume. Cardioacceleration is blunted and delayed because of cardiac denervation but persists longer into recovery because of elevated catecholamine levels.

Exercise testing has been used in subjects with valvular heart disease to quantify disability, to reproduce exercise-induced symptoms, and to evaluate responses to medical and surgical interventions. The exercise test also has been used to identify concurrent CAD, but the prevalence of false-positive responses (ST depression not attributable to ischemia) is high because of frequent baseline electrocardiographic abnormalities and LV hypertrophy.\n\nAortic Stenosis\nEffort syncope in subjects with aortic stenosis is an important and well-appreciated symptom. Practice guidelines for exercise testing list symptomatic severe aortic stenosis as an absolute contraindication for testing because of concern about syncope and cardiac arrest. Proposed mechanisms for exercise-induced syncope in subjects with aortic stenosis include carotid hyperactivity, LV failure, arrhythmia, and LV baroreceptor stimulation.\n\nExercise testing might be useful, however, in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis for the purpose of eliciting symptoms or an abnormal blood pressure response. Several studies have concluded that exercise testing is safe in both pediatric and adult subjects with aortic stenosis when performed appropriately. Protocols less intense than the standard Bruce protocol should be used, especially in older or deconditioned individuals. Attention should focus on the subject\u2019s symptoms, minute-by-minute response of blood pressure, slowing HR, and ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. Testing should be terminated if angina, dizziness, decrease in systolic blood pressure, complex ventricular arrhythmias, or >2 mm ST-segment depression occurs.\n\nIn the presence of an abnormal blood pressure response, the subject with aortic stenosis should take at least a 2-minute cool-down walk at a lower stage of exertion to avoid acute LV volume overload, which could occur when the subject lies down. In an analysis of 7 studies encompassing 491 patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis, no sudden death occurred over an average follow-up of \u22481 year in people with a normal exercise response, whereas sudden death occurred in 5% of those with abnormal test responses.\n\nAortic Regurgitation\nSubjects with aortic regurgitation usually maintain a normal exercise capacity for a longer time than those with aortic stenosis. During exercise, the decreases in diastolic duration and regurgitation volume favor forward output. As the myocardium fails, peak HR tends to slow, and ejection fraction and stroke volume decrease. Exercise testing can be useful in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation to assess functional capacity and symptom response. Surgery is usually indicated if unequivocal symptoms are elicited at a low workload.\n\nMitral Stenosis\n\nSubjects with mitral stenosis can show either a normal or an excessive increase in HR during exercise. Because stroke volume cannot be significantly increased, the normal rise of cardiac output is attenuated, and cardiac output eventually can fall during exercise; this is frequently accompanied by exercise-induced hypotension. Exercise testing with Doppler echocardiography can be useful in 2 settings: asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis with resting pulmonary artery systolic pressure <50 mmHg, and symptomatic individuals with mild mitral stenosis.

Resting, exercise, and recovery HRs and blood pressures should be tabulated according to stages, and peak exercise values should be stated. There should be a specific statement with regard to the presence or absence of chest pain at peak exercise and whether this was the reason for termination of the test. Patient effort can be defined by percent maximum predicted HR achieved or by use of a chronotropic index. Additionally, it is useful to describe effort capacity as percent of maximum predicted MET workload 22 equivalents, adjusted for age and for sex. Peak end-exercise or recovery-phase ST-segment deviation should be described, and the test should be defined as positive, negative, or equivocal according to standard ST-segment criteria. Depending on further experience and validation, additional diagnostic electrocardiographic findings that extend beyond the ST segment should be considered for inclusion in the routine report. In addition to effort capacity, prognostic information might routinely incorporate the Duke Treadmill Score and information about chronotropic response to exercise and HR recovery.\n\nExercise Training\n\n Exercise and Health\n\nRecent physical activity recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 388 the American College of Sports Medicine, 389 and the US Surgeon General 390 affirm the primary role of exercise in preventing chronic disease and in maintaining health throughout the age span. Several principles emerge from these statements, including that any exercise is better than none, more exercise is better than less, different types of exercise (aerobic versus resistance) yield distinct favorable outcomes, and activity recommendations should be enabling and flexible and avoid setting up barriers.\n\nThe goal of this section on exercise training is to provide an evidence base for the medical benefits of long-term physical activity, where exercise can be viewed as a preventive medical treatment, like a \"pill\" that should be taken on an almost daily basis. Care is taken to merge the public health benefits of exercise with the medical model, such that medical evaluation is not set up as a barrier to exercise, yet selected higher-risk individuals are properly evaluated before they initiate an exercise program to avoid an increase in adverse outcomes. In particular, patients with established heart disease or other selected chronic medical conditions should undergo a medical evaluation to ensure clinical stability, to provide specific activity recommendations, and to guide a safe progression with exercise training.\n\n Exercise Training Response in Apparently Healthy Individuals\n\nExercise training in apparently healthy people affects several physiological markers of health, including Vo \u03072max, central hemodynamic function, autonomic nervous system function, peripheral vascular and muscular function, and submaximal exercise capacity. Collectively, these adaptations result in an exercise training effect, which allows an individual to exercise longer, to higher peak workloads, with lower HRs at submaximal levels of exercise.\n\nVariable effects of the menstrual cycle on the exercise ECG have been reported among women with normal coronary arteries. One study reported shorter time to ST-segment depression more frequently during the menstrual and preovulatory phases of the cycle than during the high-progesterone postovulation phase, whereas another found more frequent ST-segment depression and shorter exercise duration during the luteal phase of the cycle. The exercise test findings correlated best with the estradiol-to-progesterone ratio (r=0.29 for time to ST-segment depression). An effect of estrogen on the ST-segment response is further suggested by the observation that false-positive stress tests among young women tend to convert to normal after bilateral hystero-salpingo-oophorectomy, an effect not seen after unilateral oophorectomy.", "start_char_idx": 83611, "end_char_idx": 88718, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82f187f9-4ec8-41d4-9626-9e34b2f793b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "82f187f9-4ec8-41d4-9626-9e34b2f793b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "662b6283efdeaeacedfe39cf93b00e29fc39f207504b3937e500aca9e46054db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "61c7cfdf-d381-4a50-b3ba-845b18e5cc58", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "72f775ed853898d877ad46a49c0140e73c0aaa68aa16fdc9c84a231cb1f29ff0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a5c9c809-6ecd-4698-b906-9dcdd393e466", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "0f601c961beafcce5b3d24801575d3ca871b6995f06e96daab1bbd0b622a41a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Variable effects of the menstrual cycle on the exercise ECG have been reported among women with normal coronary arteries.

Time to ischemia did not appear to depend on progesterone concentrations.\n\nExogenous Sex Hormones\n\nIn 1977, a study described \"worsening\" of baseline exercise-induced ST-segment depression among men and women supplemented with estrogen and amelioration of postexercise ST-segment depression among men supplemented with testosterone. In the Lipid Research Clinics Program Prevalence Study, oral contraceptive users were more likely to have abnormal exercise ECGs, whereas the difference in ST-segment depression between postmenopausal women on and not on hormone replacement did not quite reach statistical significance. The proportion of women on estrogen therapy who demonstrate abnormal exercise electrocardiographic response varies by study but has been reported to be as high as 39% among postmenopausal hormone users with concomitant normal myocardial perfusion imaging. Specificity of the exercise ECG might be improved in women taking combined estrogen-progestin therapy versus women taking estrogen monotherapy. Abnormal ST-segment responses in response to postural change and hyperventilation have also been reported with exogenous estrogen therapy. The mechanism for these estrogen-induced electrocardiographic changes remains unclear. Changes in vasomotor tone, changes in autonomic tone, and a digitalis-like effect have been proposed.\n\nThe Exercise Electrocardiographic Test Report\n\nThe exercise test report should describe information relevant to diagnosis and prognosis.

It is well established that cardiac Aerobic exercise training increases Vo \u03072max through an increase autonomic regulation can be altered by exercise conditioning. 397 Blood and urinary catecholamine levels are lower at rest and during submaximal exercise after training, reflecting less sympathetic nervous system activity. 398 The arterial baroreflex, the afferent fibers of which originate from the carotid sinus and aortic arch, regulates blood pressure on a beat-to-beat basis by continually adjusting HR, stroke volume, and peripheral resistance.

This is explained by a combination of reduced submaximal HR with a concomitant increase in stroke volume where unchanged submaximal values are reported, and/or a resultant increase in A\u2013Vo \u03072diff, thus requiring less cardiac output at a given submaximal workload.\n\n Peripheral Muscular, Vascular, and Autonomic Changes\n\nMuscular. Skeletal muscle changes after exercise training include more and larger mitochondria and increased oxidative enzyme activity, which allow for a greater sustained level. 5 In addition, trained muscle exhibits increased utilization of fatty acids during submaximal exercise, which extends endurance. Muscle fiber type and size adaptations reflect changes that enhance aerobic potential. Each of these adaptations contributes to greater capacity to use oxygen and improve endurance. Endurance training enhances the ability to perform exercise at both submaximal and maximal intensities but is specific to those muscle groups that have undergone training (training specificity). This is reflected either by the ability to exercise longer at a similar workload or by an increase in the workload attained at a given HR. Furthermore, the results of these adaptations increase the anaerobic threshold (the point at which blood lactate begins to accumulate). Adaptation to submaximal exercise is also associated with a lower HR\u2013systolic blood pressure product for a given exercise task, reflecting reduced myocardial oxygen demand for that level of work.\n\nVascular. Exercise training directly affects arterial shear stress, a stimulus to antiatherogenic adaptations in vascular function and remodeling. When considered along with evidence indicating increased coronary artery size and dilation capacity in trained subjects, studies strongly support the contention that exercise training is associated with improved vascular function. The mechanisms for these responses appear to be endothelium and nitric oxide dependent. That is, pursuant to the repeated increases in arterial wall stress with repeated bouts of exercise, nitric oxide synthase expression and activity in the arterial endothelium are increased. Additionally, training increases the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells, leading to endothelial regeneration and improved endothelial function. These findings indicate that maintaining a high level of fitness or undertaking exercise training could prevent or attenuate the typical age-related decline in indices of vascular function. 396\n\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on April 7, 2024\n\nMuscle fiber type and size adaptations reflect changes that enhance aerobic potential.

Longitudinal changes in lipid profiles as a function of changing activity and fitness levels are more difficult to demonstrate, in part because of confounding by changes in body weight and dietary intake.\n\nIn the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, changes in physical fitness and activity were weakly related to lipid levels, whereas changes in body weight were more strongly associated with lipid changes. In the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study, increases in physical activity level over 9 years of follow-up were associated with increases in HDL cholesterol among white and black women and men, whereas decreases in triglycerides were evident only among white participants and changes in LDL cholesterol only among women, especially among black women.\n\nClinical trials of exercise training as a means to modify blood lipid levels show heterogeneous results, dependent on various factors such as study participants, baseline lipoprotein profiles, differences in exercise interventions, and concomitant interventions in risk reduction programs.\n\n Exercise Training and Hypertension\n\nExercise training lowers resting blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive individuals and in patients with and without CVD. A meta-analysis of 54 trials of aerobic exercise training reported a significant reduction in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Moderate-intensity resistance training also leads to blood pressure reductions of similar magnitude.\n\nAn \"optimal\" dose of exercise for blood pressure lowering has not been defined, but even modest increases in activity, such as walking 30 to 60 minutes per week, have measurable benefits.\n---\n 906 Circulation August 20, 2013\n\n48 trials of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, another group Exercise Training and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. In individuals with established type 2 diabetes mellitus, a meta-analysis reported a weighted mean difference in systolic blood pressure of \u20133.2 mmHg (95% CI: \u20135.4 to \u20130.9 mmHg). 421 of published randomized controlled trials of exercise training revealed that exercise significantly improves glycemic control and reduces visceral adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides, but not plasma cholesterol, in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, even without weight loss. 449 A structured exercise program is more effective than simply providing physical activity recommendations. 450 In the LookAHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial, a goal of 175 minutes of exercise per week and behavioral weight loss led to improved fitness and a 6% weight loss at 4 years, associated with lower levels of hemoglobin A 1C, lower blood pressure, improved lipid measures, and less use of glucose-lowering medications, compared with usual care. 451\n\n Exercise Training and Obesity\n\nOverweight and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the United States, with recent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey documenting a prevalence of overweight (BMI >25) of 68% and a prevalence of obesity (BMI >30) of 34%. 440 In that body weight is determined by the balance between energy intake (food) and energy expenditure (resting metabolic rate, thermic effect of food [digestion], and physical activity\u2013related energy expenditure), exercise plays a major role in weight management. Current high rates of obesity are determined by both a high rate of physical inactivity and an increase in caloric intake. 401,441 Optimally, weight reduction in overweight/obese individuals is attained by a combination of reduced food intake and increased caloric expenditure (physical activity and exercise training), but weight reduction can be accomplished by diet alone or exercise alone. 442 Antiatherogenic effects of exercise and weight loss relate to favorable effects on insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, lipid profiles, inflammation, and blood clotting. 442,443 It is also notable that the best predictor of successful long-term weight loss maintenance is the presence of an ongoing exercise program with a high level of caloric expenditure. 444\n\n Anti-inflammatory Effects of Exercise Training\n\nStudies of the relationship between inflammation and physical activity and occasional and ongoing exercise were summarized in a systematic review in 2005.", "start_char_idx": 96169, "end_char_idx": 101452, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7fae298-f651-4ded-b5d0-3abf2cceedf2": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7fae298-f651-4ded-b5d0-3abf2cceedf2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "662b6283efdeaeacedfe39cf93b00e29fc39f207504b3937e500aca9e46054db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "233d48cd-bfe1-42eb-a65d-118b01a65afc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "1d44cb60cc8ad9a4214e86ec79b9b47e895370b668d3c2c1a845c001f50f8f7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "228b0aa5-d236-4af4-961e-cf5413cf73f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "fd034bc1e4a829be2cb88d5360a06e06724464fc028142d30ff60771e88c04a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Current high rates of obesity are determined by both a high rate of physical inactivity and an increase in caloric intake. 401,441 Optimally, weight reduction in overweight/obese individuals is attained by a combination of reduced food intake and increased caloric expenditure (physical activity and exercise training), but weight reduction can be accomplished by diet alone or exercise alone. 442 Antiatherogenic effects of exercise and weight loss relate to favorable effects on insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, lipid profiles, inflammation, and blood clotting. 442,443 It is also notable that the best predictor of successful long-term weight loss maintenance is the presence of an ongoing exercise program with a high level of caloric expenditure. 444\n\n Anti-inflammatory Effects of Exercise Training\n\nStudies of the relationship between inflammation and physical activity and occasional and ongoing exercise were summarized in a systematic review in 2005. Inflammatory markers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), increase soon after vigorous exercise, possibly mediated by cytokine increases or in response to muscle injury. This acute-phase response, which appears to be proportional to the amount of activity and extent of muscle injury, tends to abate within a few days and is less pronounced in trained than in untrained individuals. 452\n\n Exercise Training and Insulin Sensitivity\n\nPhysical activity has beneficial effects on both glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, including increased sensitivity to insulin, decreased production of glucose by the liver, a larger number of muscle cells that use more glucose than adipose tissue, and reduced body fat. 447 Exercise has both a short-term effect and a long-term effect that enhances insulin sensitivity and prevents type 2 diabetes mellitus. The effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity is enhanced by concomitant weight reduction. In the Diabetes Prevention Program, a combination goal of 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise and weight reduction of 7% led to a 58% reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, as compared with a control group, over 2.8 years of follow-up. Lifestyle treatment was also more effective in preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus than was metformin, which in turn was more effective than placebo. 433\n\n Exercise Training and Vascular Function\n\nNumerous observational and interventional studies have shown salutary effects of aerobic exercise training on arterial function. Aging, even in healthy adults, is accompanied by an increase in intimal-medial thickness 460 and stiffness of larger arteries 461 and a reduction in endothelium-mediated arterial vasodilator capacity. 462 Endurance-trained individuals demonstrate lower measures of carotid artery intimal-medial\n---\n Fletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 907\n\nthickness and large-artery stiffness and greater endothelium- production, thereby enhancing exercise-induced coronary mediated vasodilator function than their sedentary age peers. For example, men 55 to 75 years of age who regularly competed in road races demonstrated \u224830% lower aortofemoral pulse-wave velocity and carotid augmentation index than untrained men of similar age. As noted previously, aerobic exercise interventions lower blood pressure significantly; this reduction is generally greater in hypertensive individuals. Endurance training in adults induces remodeling of conduit arteries, resulting in reduced wall thickness and increased lumen diameter.\n\nExercise Training and Blood Clotting Plasma levels of most coagulation factors increase with age in sedentary people, but this increase is attenuated in physically active individuals. After 16 weeks of aerobic training, coagulation factor levels were generally decreased, but these beneficial changes disappeared after only 2 weeks of \u201cdetraining.\u201d In sedentary overweight adults 50 to 75 years of age, favorable effects of endurance training include reduced tissue plasminogen activator antigen levels and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels. Men with claudication attributable to PAD exhibited elevated baseline levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which were reduced by 23% after 6 months of treadmill exercise training; tissue plasminogen activator activity increased 28% over this period. Thus, ample evidence indicates that aerobic training has beneficial effects on fibrinolytic coagulation factors, especially in older adults with CVD.\n\nExercise Training and Autonomic Function The balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity modulates cardiovascular activity. Enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity is associated with an increased risk of cardiac events, particularly in patients with known heart disease. A reduction of HR variability (HRV) has been reported in several cardiac conditions, such as after MI, in heart failure, and in diabetic neuropathy. Using measures of HRV, cross-sectional studies of healthy men reported higher parasympathetic activity among those who were physically trained and fit than among those who were not.", "start_char_idx": 100488, "end_char_idx": 105607, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "228b0aa5-d236-4af4-961e-cf5413cf73f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "228b0aa5-d236-4af4-961e-cf5413cf73f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "662b6283efdeaeacedfe39cf93b00e29fc39f207504b3937e500aca9e46054db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7fae298-f651-4ded-b5d0-3abf2cceedf2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "e07a2294be7ff38b8e1804adea5784c4e0c4777a0379acd293422ffb7f2265b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1d4c3b82-485d-4154-b515-0fb84cdbfb05", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "447a04dc982829b7a8dd2e94495e97bef4c3d7b566437b6a8b51cbb19267e8b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Thus, ample evidence indicates that aerobic training has beneficial effects on fibrinolytic coagulation factors, especially in older adults with CVD.\n\nExercise Training and Autonomic Function The balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity modulates cardiovascular activity. Enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity is associated with an increased risk of cardiac events, particularly in patients with known heart disease. A reduction of HR variability (HRV) has been reported in several cardiac conditions, such as after MI, in heart failure, and in diabetic neuropathy. Using measures of HRV, cross-sectional studies of healthy men reported higher parasympathetic activity among those who were physically trained and fit than among those who were not. Exercise has been proposed to be an effective and nonpharmacological way to enhance cardiac electrical stability and serve as an antiarrhythmic intervention in humans. Improved measures of HRV and baroreflex sensitivity with exercise training have been shown in patients after infarction. It is also evident that exercise training improves the HRV in patients with chronic heart failure. Benefit of exercise training in patients with chronic heart failure is in part mediated by significant reduction in central sympathetic outflow.\n\nAnti-ischemic Effects of Exercise Training Although maximal exercise HR and blood pressure do not usually change significantly with aerobic training, HR and systolic blood pressure at fixed submaximal work rates are reduced by training, as noted earlier. Because the rate\u2013pressure product is a major determinant of myocardial oxygen demand, the reduced rate\u2013pressure product resulting from training will substantially lower oxygen demand, mimicking the anti-ischemic effects of \u03b2-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. In addition, exercise training enhances arterial nitric oxide production, thereby enhancing exercise-induced coronary vasodilation and myocardial blood flow. Consistent with these favorable effects on myocardial oxygen demand and supply, studies have demonstrated training-induced improvements in myocardial perfusion and reduction in ischemia in patients after MI and those with chronic CAD. These beneficial effects of training on myocardial perfusion are observed in both the infarct zone and remote regions.\n\nAntiarrhythmic Effects of Exercise Training A risk of ventricular fibrillation or sudden cardiac death during isolated bouts of strenuous exercise in the presence of CAD is well documented, although the risk in screened patients is exceedingly low. In the long-term setting, exercise training\u2013induced improvements in the myocardial oxygen supply\u2013demand balance and concomitant reduction in sympathetic tone and catecholamine release are postulated to attenuate the risk of ventricular fibrillation. The effects of exercise training on heart variability reflect in part decreased sympathetic and increased parasympathetic tone. This could explain the lower rate of sudden cardiac death observed in physically active individuals with known or suspected CAD or at high risk of CAD. Studies in animals after MI demonstrate an increased threshold for inducible ventricular fibrillation after exercise training.\n\nPrevention of Aging-Related Disability Because regular exercise plays an important role in maintaining mobility, exercise training is a logical intervention to reduce or prevent age-associated disability. In a systematic review of exercise interventions, it was found that trials that offered a multicomponent exercise program involving endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance training generally reported significant reductions in disability. Longer duration of the intervention and follow-up and interventions in more functionally limited individuals were associated with a greater likelihood of benefit. Interventions limited to lower-extremity strength training showed little to no benefit. The ongoing multicenter Lifestyle Interventions for Independence in Elders (LIFE) study will provide additional information on this topic. In the LIFE Pilot Study, a comprehensive physical activity intervention in 424 individuals at risk for disability (70\u201389 years of age) resulted in improved measures of physical performance and a lower incidence of major mobility disability, as reflected by inability to complete a 400-meter walk.\n\nExercise Prescription for Apparently Healthy Individuals Preexercise Screening The need for formal medical screening before the initiation of an exercise program depends on several factors, including the intensity of exercise to be undertaken, the age and cardiac risk factor status of the individual, and the presence or absence of established CVD.

This should include a medical history, a physical examination, and a risk factor profile. For most, an electrocardiographic stress test is recommended.

Of particular interest are data in the history that indicate that unsupervised exercise could be hazardous.\n\nThe physical examination should include vital signs and examination of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, including evaluation of abnormal heart sounds or murmurs; presence of wheezes or other adventitious sounds; presence of elevated BMI; presence of elevated blood pressure; presence of neuromuscular disease; and presence of joint swelling or other orthopedic issues. The risk factor profile should include blood work to determine the presence of dyslipidemia, anemia, diabetes mellitus, or prediabetes and should use the Framingham or other risk factor instrument to determine global cardiovascular risk.\n\nAn exercise test is selectively recommended if vigorous exercise is planned. (\u201cExercise Testing: Before Participation in Vigorous Exercise\u201d section.) If the test is normal, no further restrictions are needed from a cardiovascular point of view. If the test is abnormal, further work-up should follow, according to symptoms and estimates of risk. If an asymptomatic individual does not undergo an exercise test before beginning training, he or she should follow the activity guidelines outlined in Table 3.

Just as with endurance and resistance training, flexibility training is generally based on goals to progressively enhance performance. In the case of flexibility exercise, this entails stretching muscle beyond its normal resting length but not to the point of pain or injury. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends \u22654 repetitions for each exercise, with the stretching itself lasting about 15 seconds. Flexibility training then progresses to increase the extent of stretching, as well as the duration and the number of stretches to achieve further ROM benefits. Flexibility training is best performed when preceded by a general warm-up to prepare the muscles that are to be stretched; therefore, it is common to incorporate flexibility training as part of the cool-down phase of exercise training.\n\nTraditionally, stretching methods vary between 3 techniques: ballistic stretching, static stretching, and proprioceptive neuromuscular stretching. Whereas ballistic stretching entails bouncing movements to lengthen the range of muscle stretch, static stretch uses slow, sustained muscle lengthening. During proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, the body part is moved to the end of its ROM, but it is then moved even further by an assistant. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation is most common among athletic and rehabilitation programs. Ballistic and slow static exercises are more widespread, particularly because they do not depend on assistance to achieve the training benefit. Although both ballistic and slow static techniques are well-established modes to achieve increased ROM, slow stretching is less likely to cause injury or soreness.\n\nEndurance Exercise\n\nEndurance exercise entails rhythmic motion of large muscle groups in aerobic activities such as walking, jogging, cycling, and rowing. Endurance training uses the same progressive overload principle already described in relation to flexibility training. The overriding goal is to induce progressive physiological adaptations that facilitate increased exercise capacity and its related health benefits. Endurance training is prescribed in terms of intensity, duration, frequency, progression, and modality. The intensity of endurance training can range from 40% to 80% of baseline exercise capacity, depending on the fitness of an individual, as well as his or her training goals. Lower-intensity regimens can constitute an adequate training stimulus for sedentary adults and those who are older or frail. However, for most adults, training intensities of 55% to 80% of the baseline exercise capacity are well tolerated.\n\nPerformed on days that alternate with resistance training, but both modes can be combined into a single session for patients who are sufficiently vigorous and healthy to tolerate the effort. Flexibility training is an additional exercise mode that is often integrated into the warm-up or cool-down periods to provide still another dimension of benefit.\n\nWarm-Up and Cool-Down\n\nBoth warm-up and cool-down periods entail low-intensity aerobic exercises usually for 5 to 10 minutes. Warm-up maneuvers stimulate vasodilation and increased local muscle perfusion before a more intense conditioning stimulus. This activity also increases joint range of motion (ROM) and flexibility. After the conditioning phase, cool-down facilitates a gradual transition to exercise cessation, modulating the effects of vasodilation, high catecholamines, and potential ischemia. Cool-down helps the HR and blood pressure transition to normal levels, reducing the likelihood for hypotension and ventricular ectopy. Body heat, lactic acid, and adrenaline are dissipated with gradual restoration to baseline levels.\n\nActivity guidelines: Activity should be individualized, with exercise prescription provided by qualified individuals and approved by primary healthcare provider. Supervision required: Medical supervision during initial prescription session is beneficial. Supervision by appropriate trained nonmedical personnel for other exercise sessions should occur until the individual understands how to monitor his or her activity. Medical personnel should be trained and certified in Advanced Cardiac Life Support. Nonmedical personnel should be trained and certified in Basic Life Support (which includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Electrocardiographic and blood pressure monitoring: Useful during the early prescription phase of training.\n\nCAD indicates coronary artery disease; HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; MET, metabolic equivalent; MI, myocardial infarction; and VT, ventricular tachycardia.

Although the effect of resistance exercise on CVD risk factor modification is less than traditional endurance exercise, the increase in strength and potential for increased muscle mass could improve the individual\u2019s ability to become more physically active, raise the basal metabolic rate, and in older people, improve the ability to perform activities of daily living.\n\n Exercise Standards for Testing and Training\n\nIntensity that increases exercise capacity while decreasing body weight and fat stores. As the fitness level of an individual advances, the intensity of exercise training needs to advance; thus, it is important to build in prompts for both the exerciser and for the exercise supervisor to periodically reexamine the exercise prescription on the basis of the current fitness status of the individual.\n\n Activity Guidelines\n\nNo activity is recommended for conditioning purposes. Attention should be directed to treating the patient and restoring the patient to Class C or better. Daily activities must be prescribed on the basis of individual assessment by the patient\u2019s personal physician.\n\n Endurance and Resistance Training Guidelines\n\nEndurance training should have a frequency of \u22655 d/wk, intensity of 55%\u201390% maximum predicted HR or 40%\u201380% V\u0307o max or HR reserve, RPE 12\u201316, modality including walking, treadmill, cycling, etc, and duration of 30\u201360 min. Resistance training should have a frequency of 2\u20133 d/wk, intensity of 50%\u201380% of 1-RM or RPE 12\u201316, modality including various exercises for different muscle groups, and duration of 30\u201345 min.\n\n Additional Information\n\nJogging or brisk walking, on level ground or a treadmill, has historically been regarded as a primary exercise mode to achieve appropriate levels of energy expenditure and derive cardiovascular benefits. Desirable levels of energy expenditure and cardiovascular benefits can also be achieved with other exercise modes such as cycling, aerobic dance, elliptical training, and water-based exercise modalities. Prescribing exercises that a person enjoys and tolerates comfortably is important for long-term compliance.\n\nAerobic interval training (AIT) is an endurance training strategy that contrasts with traditional continuous training modes. Interval training involves intense exercise periods alternating with relatively lower-intensity recovery periods. AIT has been applied more frequently to various populations since the 1990s, including adults with heart disease.\n\nDetailed guidelines for resistance training and progressive resistance training programming are provided. Programs including a single set of different exercises performed 2 to 3 days per week can elicit favorable adaptations and improvements. Intensity of training is prescribed relative to the 1-repetition maximum (1-RM).\n\n Behavioral Aspects of Initiating and Sustaining an Exercise Program\n\nThe promotion of physical activity for adults requires an understanding of the principles of behavior change and habit development. Additionally, barriers to physical activity and\n---\n 912 Circulation August 20, 2013\n\nCorrelates of success with long-term exercise should be considered. An evaluation of an individual\u2019s readiness for change is appropriate before considering a major behavior change such as embarking on an exercise program. Five components of behavior change and self-regulation include: (1) setting of realistic and simple goals, (2) self-monitoring of personal behaviors linked to goal attainment, (3) feedback about progress toward goals, (4) self-evaluation of progress, and (5) corrective behavior leading to effective movement toward goals. These principles are relevant whether an individual is embarking on exercise in a home-based or in a group format. In adults >55 years of age, more than two thirds of individuals perceive barriers to physical activity, including weather, neighborhood safety, and quality of sidewalks, in addition to lack of time, energy, and motivation. Exercises that are most likely to be successful in the long term are moderate in intensity, relatively inexpensive, simple, and convenient and include a social component.\n\n Evaluation and Exercise Prescription in Patients With CVD\n\nExercise training in patients with CVD has been documented to increase exercise capacity, reduce or eliminate angina pectoris, and markedly increase walking distance in patients with claudication.

A randomized, controlled clinical trial in patients with systolic heart failure documented an 11% reduction in total mortality or hospitalization in patients randomized to exercise training versus sedentary controls after adjustment for selected baseline variables. Exercise training in patients with CVD has multiple other therapeutic benefits. Despite such beneficial effects, exercise training is not consistently prescribed for patients with CVD, as evidenced by the fact that only 14% to 35% of qualified patients are referred to cardiac rehabilitation programs after MI and \u224831% after bypass surgery. The reasons for such underutilization are unclear but probably include provider-related factors, medical system factors, and patient-related factors. Nevertheless, nearly all patients with diagnosed heart disease can benefit from an individualized exercise training regimen. Accordingly, there is a need to design, evaluate, and implement evidence-based alternative approaches to traditional cardiac rehabilitation that help provide all appropriate patients affordable access to clinically effective secondary prevention programs.\n\n Preexercise Clinical Screening\n\nThe clinical evaluation of patients considered for exercise training is designed to identify those in whom exercise training should be prohibited or delayed and those in whom exercise training is unlikely to produce benefit and to design an appropriate exercise prescription for participants.\n\n History and Physical Examination\n\nPatients with CAD can initiate exercise training within a week after an acute coronary syndrome, provided the patient is clinically stable. Consequently, the history and physical examination should ensure that the patient does not have unstable ischemic symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, or potentially life-threatening arrhythmias that might be exacerbated by exercise training. In addition, the physical examination should determine if there are orthopedic issues that could be worsened by physical activity. Patients with lower-extremity orthopedic problems or neuropathy might benefit from non\u2013weight-bearing forms of exercise training, such as ergometry or swimming. Patients with CAD who have undergone recent cardiac surgery should be examined for wound infections and sternal instability to ensure that they do not engage in physical activities that would hamper healing. For these patients, it is broadly accepted that there should be a delay in the initiation of an upper-extremity resistance training program after surgery (ie, 4\u20136 weeks). Similarly, integrity of catheterization access sites should be examined to rule out fistulae and pseudoaneurysms that could be worsened by exercise training. For patients with claudication, the physician should ensure that the patient does not have rest pain, skin ulcers of the feet, or an extremely limited exercise tolerance because such patients are unlikely to improve with exercise training alone. The physical examination in patients with peripheral vascular disease should ensure that no skin lesions exist that would be worsened with exercise or that could be attributable to extremely low perfusion. Such an examination of the lower extremities and feet is especially important in patients with CVD and diabetes mellitus.\n---\n Fletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 913\n\nevery 750000 patient-hours of participation. 421,508The observation that the incidence of cardiac arrest is 6-fold higher than the death rate indicates the value of successful resuscitation during supervised cardiac rehabilitation but also suggests that the death rate likely would be higher during unsupervised exercise. Because cardiovascular events during supervised exercise training are rare, there are no established predictors as to which CVD patients will suffer exercise-related cardiac events. Prognosis for patients with heart disease generally worsens with the extent of disease, reduced LV function, inducible ischemia, and the presence of cardiac arrhythmias. Consequently, patients with an LV ejection fraction &lt;50%, exercise-induced ischemia or complex ventricular arrhythmias, or hemodynamically significant residual coronary stenoses are likely to be at increased risk and should be considered for supervised exercise training.\n\nSupervision and Monitoring of Exercise Training\n\nThe level of supervision and monitoring of exercise training must be considered on the basis of the type of patient, staff, facility, and resources.

For the apparently healthy individual, no supervision is needed (Table 3). For those with unstable disease, no activity is recommended (Table 6). Additional guidelines are provided for moderate- to high-risk and low-risk subjects.\n\nMedically Supervised Exercise\n\nModerate- to High-Risk Subjects (Class C). Activity programs are needed to provide close medical supervision for individuals who are at moderate to high risk for a complication associated with vigorous physical activity. Such individuals are largely from Class C (Table 5). These patients require careful medical supervision and surveillance to ensure that the activity is well tolerated. A physician should be immediately available for these classes, although the presence of a properly trained and experienced nurse or exercise physiologist in the exercise room is sufficient if a physician is not in the exercise area. The qualifications of the physician may vary, but experience in the treatment of patients with heart disease is required. Training programs should be medically supervised until the safety of the prescribed activity has been established.\n\nLow-Risk Subjects. Low-risk subjects (Class B) benefit from medically supervised programs because vigorous exercise can be conducted more safely, and group dynamics often help subjects comply with good health behaviors. Medical supervision of low-risk subjects can be provided by a well-trained nurse or exercise physiologist working under a physician\u2019s standard orders. If direct medical supervision by a physician is not provided, the supervisor should have successfully completed an AHA-sponsored course in Advanced Cardiac Life Support and should be able to administer emergency medications. Well-trained cardiovascular nurses usually meet these requirements.\n\nIf individuals carefully watch for signs of intolerance such as chest pain or shortness of breath and are attentive to HR and RPE, this activity level is considered safe. Walking is a safe, low-impact, controllable exercise that, in most cases, generates an intensity that is 40% to 70% of Vo \u03072max. ROM exercises and light calisthenics can be performed in an unmonitored setting.\n\nElectrocardiographic Monitoring During Exercise Training\n\nVarious recommendations exist with regard to the number of electrocardiographic-monitored sessions that are necessary and reasonable in an exercise training program. No controlled clinical trials have specifically evaluated this issue. Some programs use as few as 6 sessions, with progression in mode and intensity of the exercise during these periods, whereas others have used as many as 36 sessions of electrocardiographic monitoring. It is recommended that the classifications outlined in Tables 4 and 5 be used as a general guideline. Importantly, the ultimate judgment must remain with the medical supervisor of the cardiac rehabilitation program and must include consideration of the patient, staff, and exercise setting.\n---\n Effects of Exercise Training in Patients With CVD\n\nExercise capacity and the short-term physiological responses to exercise improve with training in individuals with established CVD. The increase in peak aerobic capacity is attributable to a combination of central (or cardiac) adaptations and peripheral adaptations.\n\n Peak Oxygen Uptake\n\nSubjects with heart disease frequently demonstrate an increase in Vo\u03072max with aerobic exercise training. Although the absolute magnitude of the change is often less in subjects with CVD than that observed in apparently healthy individuals, the proportional increase is similar and can exceed that seen in normal individuals, favorably impacting performance of activities of daily living.\n\nFor individuals with heart failure, absolute increases in Vo\u03072max with training are somewhat limited, but even these small changes have a significant impact on the restoration of the ability to perform daily activities and are correlated with an improved prognosis.\n\nCardiac Output\n\nAn increase in peak cardiac output can result from the subject\u2019s ability or willingness to increase peak exercise intensity, including peak HR and perhaps stroke volume, during subsequent testing as compared with an initial test. In addition, exercise training has been suggested to improve vasomotor function (eg, coronary dilation), providing the possibility of increased myocardial oxygen delivery to cardiac muscle and thereby potentially increased stroke volume.\n\nSubmaximal cardiac output might be lower at a given workload, primarily the result of lower HR, with maintenance of Vo\u03072 provided by a widening of peripheral arteriovenous Vo\u03072 difference after training.

In studies of high-intensity exercise training (\u224890% Vo\u03072max) in patients with heart failure or CAD, there are indications that cardiac function, including ejection fraction, stroke volume, diastolic function, and wall motion parameters, is also improved.\n\nMyocardial Oxygen Demand\n\nPrimarily as the result of peripheral metabolic changes, exercise training for individuals with CAD promotes lower myocardial oxygen demand at any given absolute workload, resulting in lower HR, systolic blood pressure, and circulating catecholamines. The benefits of these adaptations can be demonstrated by the greater amount of work that can be done before angina or ischemic ST depression occurs. Moreover, several studies suggest that there is an improvement in myocardial oxygen supply (ie, coronary blood flow) at a given level of myocardial oxygen demand after training.\n\nAutonomic Function\n\nHR recovery measured at exercise testing is reflective of vagal tone and is an independent marker of overall risk of death. HR recovery improves after Phase II cardiac rehabilitation and is associated with decreased risk of all-cause death.\n\n Prognostic Benefits of Exercise in Patients With CVD\n\nCardiorespiratory fitness, as measured objectively by the assessment of peak oxygen uptake, is a powerful, independent predictor of death in patients with known cardiac disease. One study of men with a history of heart disease demonstrated that a 1-MET increment was related to age-adjusted decreased risks of 18% and 32% for nonfatal and fatal cardiac events, respectively. Other investigations have shown comparable findings. In patients referred for cardiac rehabilitation, peak Vo\u03072 cut points of <15, 15 to 22, and >22 mL kg\u22121 min\u22121 were associated with multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for cardiac deaths and all-cause deaths. In patients with heart failure, a meta-analysis revealed a 39% risk reduction for death among exercise-trained patients.\n\n Home-Monitored Cardiac Rehabilitation\n\nIn a systematic review of data from 12 randomized controlled trials (1938 participants) conducted in 6 different countries, the effectiveness of home-based cardiac rehabilitation was compared with supervised traditional cardiac rehabilitation; no difference in outcomes was found among patients receiving home-based or center-based cardiac rehabilitation either in the short term (3\u201312 months) or longer term (up to 24 months). Most of these studies monitored home exercise by using measures of perceived exertion to approximate exercise intensity. Transtelephonic electrocardiographic monitoring at home has been studied as a substitute for outpatient visits to the clinic. Such programs have the disadvantage of lacking immediate emergency medical care but the advantage of not requiring an on-site clinic visit. These programs can be particularly useful in rural settings. One program reported using both electrocardiographic and voice transtelephonic monitoring, which supported both the efficacy and safety of home programs. The importance of alternative approaches with novel technologies is discussed in detail in a recent AHA science advisory on this topic.\n---\n Fletcher et al Exercise Standards for Testing and Training 915\n\nversus controls. 537 These results are similar to those of recommended for such patients until further data on safety and efficacy are available.\n\nanother meta-analysis, in which a 35% reduction in risk of death and a 28% reduction in the composite end point of death and hospitalization were found with exercise training. 538 More recently, a large multicenter trial demonstrated a multivariate-adjusted reduction of 11% in the combined end point of all-cause death and hospitalization and a 15% reduction in the combined end point of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization.

Finally, in older adults (\u226560 years of age), the highest level of cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with lower all-cause death (hazard ratio = 0.59) and death from CVD (hazard ratio = 0.57). 539The impact of exercise training on fitness and ultimately on risk of death appears to be attributable to improvement in CVD risk factors, such as enhanced fibrinolysis, improved endothelial function, decreased sympathetic tone, and likely other, as yet undetermined, factors. 540\u2013543\n\nTargeting Exercise Prescription to Relevant Outcomes\n\nAlthough general guidelines for exercise training noted in the earlier section (\u201cExercise Training Techniques\u201d) provide benefits for both health and fitness for the adult population at large, the exercise prescription can be tailored with regard to individual needs, conditions, and comorbidities to attain specific health outcomes.\n\nMaximizing Fitness\n\nExercise training programs generally are designed to improve aerobic fitness and include the prescriptive components of intensity, duration, frequency, progression, and modality, as discussed in previous sections and as outlined in detail elsewhere. 45 For patients with CVD, intensity usually is determined on the basis of results from the baseline exercise test by any of the following methods: 40% to 80% of peak exercise capacity with the HR reserve; in patients who have performed a CPX, 40% to 80% measured Vo \u03072 reserve, or % peak Vo \u03072. The intensity may be further modified by using the subjective RPE scale of 12 to 16 on a scale of 6 to 20. 219Among patients with an ischemic response during exercise, the intensity should be prescribed at an HR just below the onset of ischemic symptoms (by \u224810 beats). The ischemic threshold is most often determined as the HR at which typical angina begins to occur. The goal duration of exercise at the prescribed intensity is generally 30 to 60 minutes per session.\n\nAIT involves alternating 3- to 4-minute periods of exercise at very high intensity (90%\u201395% HR) with 3-minute intervals at a moderate intensity (60%\u201370% HR peak). Such training for \u224840 minutes 3 times per week has been shown to yield greater improvements in peak Vo \u03072 than those seen with standard continuous, moderate-intensity exercise. 495,496Although AIT has long been used in athletic training and appears to have promise in patients with CVD, AIT cannot yet be broadly\n\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on April 7, 2024\n---\n Exercise Training for Chronic Heart Failure and After Heart Transplantation\n\nExercise training is effective in improving exercise capacity, symptoms, and quality of life in patients with impaired LV systolic function and chronic heart failure. In an international randomized controlled trial of exercise training for 2331 outpatients with stable systolic heart failure (HF-ACTION; Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training), it was found that after adjustment for prognostic baseline characteristics, exercise training was associated with an 11% reduction in combined all-cause death or hospitalization (P=0.03). Similarly, in a meta-analysis of exercise training trials in patients with chronic heart failure, exercise training significantly reduced deaths and hospital admissions. Accordingly, exercise training is recommended as a component of a comprehensive approach to the patient with stable chronic heart failure. However, only a few exercise training studies have addressed patients with chronic heart failure and preserved LV ejection fraction. Exercise training in patients with chronic heart failure has been shown to reduce HR at rest and submaximal exercise and to increase peak aerobic capacity. These favorable changes are attributable to a broad range of mechanisms.

These patients tend to be profoundly deconditioned before device implantation and remain so after implantation. Early mobilization and ambulation are keys to recovery. Exercise physiology in recipients of LV assist devices is complex and depends on the type of device, device settings, function of the native left and right ventricles, and peripheral\n---\nExercise Training in Valvular Heart Disease\n\nDepending on the valvular orifice size and the resting gradient, patients with mild aortic or mitral stenosis can perform isotonic exercises, provided the response to exercise stress testing is normal. Patients with moderate stenosis can indulge in low- to moderate-intensity isotonic exercises as tolerated. Patients with severe stenosis should be restricted from intense isotonic or isometric exercises but can perform low-level activities as tolerated. Previous level of training, type of cardiac disease and valve replaced, and postoperative functional status can influence the exercise recommendations after valve replacement. Patients with mitral valve disease have a markedly lower exercise tolerance postoperatively than those with aortic valve disease and thus are candidates for a different, lower-level exercise training program. There is evidence available to show that the avoidance of patient\u2013prosthesis mismatch can result in better exercise capacity for patients after aortic valve replacement. Selected patients with very low postoperative exercise capacity should undergo echocardiography to rule out patient\u2013prosthesis mismatch. Electrocardiographic monitoring should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nExercise Training in PAD\n\nPatients with PAD are commonly limited in their daily activities by claudication or leg fatigue during exercise that involves dynamic motion of calf and leg muscles. An exercise treadmill test before exercise training is useful to evaluate walking capacity and the degree of exercise limitation. However, some patients could have severe symptoms that preclude the performance of an exercise test. If testing is performed, protocols that begin at low work rates and have low work rate increments per stage, including individualized ramp protocols, can be especially useful. Exercise training with treadmill walking has been used most frequently in clinical trials. The treadmill walking exercise prescription for patients with PAD and symptoms of intermittent claudication consists of intermittent bouts of walking exercise at a work rate that brings on claudication until the patient has an ischemic leg pain score of mild\u2013moderate (3\u20134 on a 5-point scale), followed by rest until pain completely subsides, and then resumption of exercise at a similar intensity. The rest and exercise bouts are repeated for a total of 50 minutes per day, including rest periods. Patients can progress to a higher work rate when 8-minute bouts of exercise are attained. Patients with PAD without intermittent claudication should follow the exercise prescription for patients with CVD outlined previously (\u201cMaximizing Fitness\u201d). In all patients with PAD, treadmill walking exercise is the preferred modality, but supplemental exercise with other exercise modalities, including resistance training as recommended for patients with CVD, could be of additional benefit. A recent multicenter randomized controlled trial documented that supervised exercise training delivered for 3 hours per week over 6 months was superior to primary stenting for aortoiliac disease with regard to the primary outcome of peak walking time. The topic of exercise training in PAD is discussed in detail elsewhere.\n---\n 918 Circulation August 20, 2013\n\nPatients with certain cardiovascular conditions may participate in various activities based on their exercise test results and overall health status:\n\n- Patients with hemodynamically excellent tetralogy of Fallot repair or arterial switch procedure for transposition of the great arteries may participate in all activities if they have normal exercise tests.\n- Patients with mild Ebstein disease may also participate in activities based on specific criteria.\n- Patients with more severe unrepaired congenital anomalies or significant residual lesions may engage in competitive sports with reassuring exercise tests and monitoring.\n- Patients with the most serious cardiovascular conditions are restricted from competitive sports.\n\n Intracardiac Defibrillators\n\nAn intracardiac defibrillator (ICD) uses heart rate as the primary method of tachycardia detection.", "start_char_idx": 21616, "end_char_idx": 27122, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ba83ef7-ae09-4e48-996a-5a7b5ee00fb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ba83ef7-ae09-4e48-996a-5a7b5ee00fb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "662b6283efdeaeacedfe39cf93b00e29fc39f207504b3937e500aca9e46054db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3518a0fc-7de5-4028-b751-6f161d454568", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "65fff267c85fb4c92653e768113edd9634f20e7a8bbd8afc17c799f912fbf513", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_adb91af1-9837-4a36-87c1-45cdd64a67ac_200_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "", "file_path": "/content/data/Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_name": "Exercise Standards for Testing and Training (2013).pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 849879, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "847baa5cce6cff328f666eeca33f7c0c69f90d8511a33a6a55e9b3ba22bf9e19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The topic of exercise training in PAD is discussed in detail elsewhere.\n---\n 918 Circulation August 20, 2013\n\nPatients with certain cardiovascular conditions may participate in various activities based on their exercise test results and overall health status:\n\n- Patients with hemodynamically excellent tetralogy of Fallot repair or arterial switch procedure for transposition of the great arteries may participate in all activities if they have normal exercise tests.\n- Patients with mild Ebstein disease may also participate in activities based on specific criteria.\n- Patients with more severe unrepaired congenital anomalies or significant residual lesions may engage in competitive sports with reassuring exercise tests and monitoring.\n- Patients with the most serious cardiovascular conditions are restricted from competitive sports.\n\n Intracardiac Defibrillators\n\nAn intracardiac defibrillator (ICD) uses heart rate as the primary method of tachycardia detection.

It is, therefore, appropriate that the medical profession examine the impact of developing technology on the practice and cost of medical care. Such analyses, carefully conducted, could potentially have an impact on the cost of medical care without diminishing the effectiveness of that care.\n\nTo this end, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association in 1980 established a Task Force on Assessment of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Cardiovascular Procedures with the following charge:\n\nThe task force of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association shall define the role of specific noninvasive and invasive procedures in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe task force shall address, when appropriate, the contribution, uniqueness, sensitivity, specificity, indications, contraindications, and cost-effectiveness of such specific procedures.\n\nThe task force shall include a chairman and six members, three representatives from the American Heart Association and three representatives from the American College of Cardiology. The task force may select ad hoc members as needed upon the approval of the presidents of both organizations. Recommendations of the task force are forwarded to the president of each organization.\n\nThe members of the task force are George A. Beller, MD; Roman W. DeSanctis, MD; Harold T. Dodge, MD; J. Ward Kennedy, MD; T. Joseph Reeves, MD; Sylvan Lee Weinberg, MD; and Charles Fisch, MD, Chairman.\n\n I. Introduction\n\nA. Defining the Role of Electrocardiography in Clinical Practice\n\nEinthoven published the first description of his string galvanometer in 1901 and the first results of its application in 1903. The first commercial string galvanometer was manufactured by the Cambridge Instrument Company of London in 1908. In the years since these major milestones, electrocardiography has undergone significant technical advances and has become the most widely employed technical procedure for evaluating cardiovascular function. It remains an important keystone for the care of patients with both cardiac and noncardiac diseases. It is painless, without direct risk to the patient, and is reproducible. Compared with many other procedures, it is relatively inexpensive to perform.\n\nThe basic electrophysiologic principles underlying clinical electrocardiography are usually taught in physiology courses in medical schools, and some medical students learn rudimentary electrocardiography during their clinical years in medical school. However, most physicians who interpret electrocardiograms (ECGs) become experienced and develop skills in interpretation during residency or cardiovascular fellowship training and subsequently in clinical practice. In recent years, computers have become an integral part of some ECG systems. Although computer programs can usually provide accurate information regarding the heart rate, intervals, and electrical axes, all computer ECG interpretation\n\n\"Guidelines for Electrocardiography\" was approved by the American College of Cardiology Board of Trustees on October 20, 1991, and by the American Heart Association Steering Committee on October 16, 1991.\n\nRequests for reprints should be sent to the Office of Scientific Affairs, American Heart Association, 7272 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, TX 75231-4596.\n---\n 1222 Circulation Vol 85, No 3 March 1992\n\nInterpretations, particularly interpretations of rhythm disturbances, ischemia, or infarction, require careful over-reading by a physician qualified to interpret ECGs.

Before an ECG can have proper diagnostic accuracy and clinical usefulness, a skilled physician is required to compare it with previous tracings and, particularly, to integrate clinical data and provide a differential diagnosis. No computer program for ECG interpretation can replace the interpretation provided by a skilled physician. An incorrect ECG diagnosis can have significant undesirable medical and legal consequences.\n\nIn considering the appropriate use of electrocardiography, the physician should examine the clinical question being asked, the additional information to be derived, and the usefulness of the new information in establishing a diagnosis or making a management decision. The unique role of the responsible physician should always be kept in mind. Thus, there are circumstances when the physician's judgment transcends the specific recommendations of these (or other) guidelines.\n\nFor example, there may be instances when it is very appropriate to obtain an ECG in a patient with an acute illness even when no cardiac symptom, physical finding, or risk factor is present or when none of the commonly recognized indications for an ECG are present (Class I or II categories of this report). In other instances, an ECG may be obtained as a baseline study before another procedure such as an exercise test or a signal-averaged ECG is performed or before the patient undergoes a high-risk procedure or is treated with some pharmacologic agents.\n\nThe ECG is the product of a unique technology that provides a record of electrical activity of the heart and information not readily obtained by other methods. It has many uses, including serving as an independent marker of myocardial disease, reflecting electrophysiologic, anatomic, metabolic, and hemodynamic alterations, providing information essential for the proper diagnosis and therapy of a variety of cardiac disorders, and being without equal as a noninvasive method for the diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias. It is the procedure of first choice in patients presenting with chest pain, dizziness, or syncope-symptoms that may be predictive of sudden death or myocardial infarction.\n\nElectrocardiographic abnormalities may also be the first indicators of life-threatening side effects of drugs or of severe metabolic or electrolyte disturbance and occasionally may be the only sign of myocardial disease such as, for example, \"asymptomatic\" myocardial infarction in the aged.\n\nConsideration of sensitivity and specificity. Appropriate, accurate use of the ECG requires an understanding and appreciation of its sensitivity and specificity. The task of achieving this understanding is somewhat more complex for the ECG than for many other laboratory tests because the ECG is composed of several waveforms, each of which has its own sensitivity and specificity and each of which may be influenced differently by a variety of pathologic and pathophysiologic factors.\n\nWhen one considers the sensitivity and specificity of the ECG, it is important to recognize that the ECG is a record of electrical activity. Consequently, diagnoses of structural changes (myocardial infarction, hypertrophy) or pathophysiologic changes (electrolyte disturbance, effect of drugs) are made by inference and are therefore subject to error. The data that allow for a diagnosis by inference have been derived from extensive studies correlating the ECG with a variety of clinical, pathologic, and experimental states.\n\nIt is also important to recognize that the same ECG pattern may be recorded in patients with different structural and pathophysiologic states. This explains the frequent low specificity of the ECG for determining the etiology and anatomy of cardiovascular disease. For example, the ST segment and the T wave changes are generally the most common and the most sensitive ECG abnormalities, but these changes are at the same time the least specific. Similarly, different etiologic factors and structural abnormalities may result in an identical ECG pattern of bundle branch block.\n\nIt is apparent from these considerations that the sensitivity and specificity of the ECG depend to a large extent on the specific clinical question being asked. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the ECG for myocardial disorders vary considerably depending on the cause of the disorder and on the size and location of the pathologic process, whereas they are consistently high for arrhythmias. The ECG is the only practical, noninvasive method of recording and analyzing abnormalities of cardiac rhythm.\n\nThis report is intended to provide guidelines rather than standards. Furthermore, because it is impossible to consider all clinical situations, the general principles underlying the examples in these guidelines can be extended to other specific cases by the responsible physician, utilizing his or her best clinical judgment.", "start_char_idx": 4043, "end_char_idx": 9145, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f343b5f-54ba-4447-aa67-3542bae549e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f343b5f-54ba-4447-aa67-3542bae549e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Guidelines For Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_name": "Guidelines For Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1766014, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee610123-30a8-44af-9500-73ba5319289f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Guidelines For Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_name": "Guidelines For Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1766014, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "85f438ebb0e1312343727b9a5d032507ab238316a36686adcae68ec5de522f0d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eec93800-f08e-4442-808f-3db214f57e5e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Guidelines For Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_name": "Guidelines For Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1766014, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "19519860cec3174da1af6e054dff89bb88181b00bc906c5add18d87df115eafa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_ee610123-30a8-44af-9500-73ba5319289f_6_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Class\nType: Text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Description\nType: Text\nSummary: None", "file_path": "/content/data/Guidelines For Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_name": "Guidelines For Electrocardiography.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1766014, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "9eb3663d1c5ff3639e0881e292dd608f779ce6fa4ed376e084650346f803c7ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Similarly, different etiologic factors and structural abnormalities may result in an identical ECG pattern of bundle branch block.\n\nIt is apparent from these considerations that the sensitivity and specificity of the ECG depend to a large extent on the specific clinical question being asked.

Definition of Terms\n\nTo ensure compatibility of data transfer among varying sources of information pertaining to the ECG and to ensure the correct exchange of information among multiple sources of information, the definitions of terms employed need to be as precise as possible. The following definitions are used in this document:\n\n- Electrocardiogram (ECG): A standard 12-lead ECG, with or without a rhythm strip or other special leads, that has been interpreted by a physician qualified to interpret ECGs and that has been made part of the patient's medical record. An ECG that has been interpreted by a computer alone is not recognized as a properly interpreted ECG. The term ECG does not refer to continuous ambulatory electrocardiography, monitor leads, rhythm strips, exercise testing, transtelephonic recordings, signal-averaging techniques with late potentials, or intracardiac electrograms. In most cases a 12-lead ECG is required for accurate interpretation of these latter studies or is necessary to provide complementary information. In children and selected adults, it may be necessary to record additional leads.\n- Cardiovascular disease: Disease in which the heart, pericardium, or blood vessels are directly or indirectly involved. Examples of direct involvement include coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, congenital heart disease, arrhythmias, and conduction disturbances. Examples of indirect involvement or conditions with comorbidity that could affect the heart include systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and serum electrolyte abnormalities. The conditions may be permanent or transient, or progressive nonprogressive, life-threatening, or usually associated with a good prognosis. These descriptors and the presence or absence of new or changing symptoms, physical signs, or laboratory findings are important in determining the frequency of repeat 12-lead ECGs.\n- Cardiovascular dysfunction: Dysfunction with or without documented underlying organic heart disease. The dysfunction may indicate either inappropriate mechanical performance or electrical dysfunction evidenced by arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities.\n- Response to therapy: Improvement or worsening of the cardiovascular disease or dysfunction in response to treatment directed either to the underlying condition (for example, valve replacement, antiarrhythmic drug) or to the indirectly responsible cause (for example, antihypertensive therapy).\n- Follow-up: The use of serial ECGs to aid in the assessment of the severity and progression of the underlying cardiovascular disease or dysfunction. The interval between ECGs should be a medical judgment made by the responsible physician after evaluation of many factors.\n\nIII. Introduction to Indications for Electrocardiography in Different Patient Groups\n\nThe indications that follow for the use of electrocardiography have been classified by the following three patient groups.\n\n- Group IV: Patients with known cardiovascular disease or dysfunction\n- Group V: Patients who are suspected of having, or who are at increased risk of developing, cardiovascular disease or dysfunction\n- Group VI: Patients with no apparent or suspected heart disease or dysfunction\n\nWithin each group, indications are separated according to the following categories:\n\n- A. Baseline or initial evaluation\n- B. Response to therapy\n- C. Follow-up\n- D. Before surgery\n\nIt must be kept in mind that for any individual patient both the group and the category of indication may change with time.\n\nIV. Indications for Electrocardiography in Patients With Known Cardiovascular Disease or Dysfunction\n\nA. Baseline or Initial Evaluation\n\n1. General considerations.

Response to Therapy\n\n1. General considerations. After the initial evaluation, subsequent ECGs may be indicated to evaluate short-term and long-term responses to therapy. Conditions in which serial ECGs may be useful in this regard include, but are not limited to, the following: regression or progression of chamber enlargement or myocardial hypertrophy, resolution or alterations of arrhythmias or conduction disturbances, pacemaker function, acute myocardial infarction or ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, pericarditis, endocarditis, myocarditis, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), transplant rejection, infiltrative cardiomyopathies, therapy with anti-neoplastic agents, and other conditions known to produce ECG changes. When patients with these conditions receive therapy that is not expected to influence the ECG findings, they do not usually require a repeat ECG unless it is indicated by the appearance of new symptoms or findings. In general, the frequency of repeat ECGs is determined by the specific condition and left to the judgment of the patient's physician. Repeat or serial ECGs are often indicated until the patient's disease process and ECG response to therapy have stabilized. In different situations this may require multiple ECG recordings over a period of minutes, hours, days, weeks, or years.\n\n2. Selected examples of frequently encountered problems. In patients with acute ischemia, the ECG may be used to assess reversal or progression of this condition. Serial ECGs are therefore appropriately used to monitor responses to thrombolytic or anti-ischemic therapy or to verify spontaneous recovery. They may be used for similar reasons in patients with myocarditis, pericarditis, or endocarditis.\n\nIn patients who have undergone coronary angioplasty or other intracardiac invasive procedures or electrophysiologic ablative procedures, serial ECGs are warranted until the condition is stable and again shortly before hospital discharge in all patients, including those with uncomplicated procedures.\n\nIn patients in whom antiarrhythmic drug therapy is initiated, serial ECGs may be useful to assess conversion to normal sinus rhythm, changing rhythm, QRS duration, prolongation of the QT interval, or proarrhythmia. Patients who are being monitored may require a 12-lead ECG if one or more of these changes is suspected, particularly alterations in the PR, QRS, and QT intervals and relevant morphologic changes.\n\nPatients receiving drug therapy with potential cardiac effects: Many drugs that are used for either cardiovascular conditions or noncardiovascular conditions may produce cardiac effects that may be detected by the ECG even if their primary pharmacologic action is not best monitored by electrocardiography. Electrocardiographic recordings are appropriate after initiation of drug therapy, after changes in therapy, and after addition to the regimen of other drugs that may interact and have cardiac effects.\n\n 3.

Unfortunately, no large, statistically valid, prospective long-term studies have been conducted to determine the cost-effectiveness of such recommendations. A recent review of the available studies concluded that data were insufficient to support performing a routine baseline ECG in young healthy persons without evidence of cardiac disease or cardiovascular risk factors. In presumably normal persons who are known to have had a normal ECG in the past, the likelihood is low that a repeat ECG will be specifically helpful in the absence of a change in general health status or a new onset of cardiac symptoms. Because the value of a screening ECG has not been completely identified, its proper use is best determined by the responsible physician for an individual patient. Additional prospective studies on the use of baseline or screening ECGs are needed.\n\nThe cost-effectiveness of ECGs obtained routinely for hospital admissions or before surgery has also come under scrutiny, although this practice has been and is recommended in selected patient groups. The cost-effectiveness of the preoperative ECG in apparently healthy persons has also not been adequately evaluated by a large, prospective study.\n\nIt has been recognized that more stringent examination standards must be applied to persons in high-risk occupations and to those whose performance affects the safety of others.\n\nThe baseline or initial evaluation described below may be a routine physical examination, preemployment insurance school health examination, examination preceding the start of a weight reduction or exercise program, routine hospital admission, or any other cardiac screening program in which the patient has previously not been known or suspected to have heart disease or an increased risk of having heart disease.\n\nWhen persons in this category (patients with no apparent or suspected heart disease or dysfunction) develop or are found to have symptoms, signs, risk factors, or ECG or other laboratory findings that suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular disease or dysfunction, they then belong in the preceding group of patients.\n\n A.

A variety of mostly hereditary, structural, or electrical cardiac disorders are associated with SCD in young athletes, the majority of which can be identified or suggested by abnormalities on a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Whether used for diagnostic or screening purposes, physicians responsible for the cardiovascular care of athletes should be knowledgeable and competent in ECG interpretation in athletes. However, in most countries a shortage of physician expertise limits wider application of the ECG in the care of the athlete. A critical need exists for physician education in modern ECG interpretation that distinguishes normal physiological adaptations in athletes from distinctly abnormal findings suggestive of underlying pathology. Since the original 2010 European Society of Cardiology recommendations for ECG interpretation in athletes, ECG standards have evolved quickly over the last decade; pushed by a growing body of scientific data that both tests proposed criteria sets and establishes new evidence to guide refinements. On February 26-27, 2015, an international group of experts in sports cardiology, inherited cardiac disease, and sports medicine convened in Seattle, Washington, to update contemporary standards for ECG interpretation in athletes. The objective of the meeting was to define and revise ECG interpretation standards based on new and emerging research and to develop a clear guide to the proper evaluation of ECG abnormalities in athletes. This statement represents an international consensus for ECG interpretation in athletes and provides expert opinion-based recommendations linking specific ECG abnormalities and the secondary evaluation for conditions associated with SCD.

In February 2015, an international group of experts convened to update contemporary recommendations for ECG interpretation in asymptomatic athletes age 12 to 35 years.\n\nThe goals of the summit meeting were to:\n\n1. Update ECG interpretation standards based on new and emerging research.\n2. Develop a clear guide to the appropriate evaluation of ECG abnormalities for conditions associated with SCD in athletes.\n\nIn the presence of cardiac symptoms or a family history of inherited cardiovascular disease or premature SCD, a normal ECG should not preclude further assessment.\n\nThis document provides the most updated evidence-based recommendations developed with Southern University, Statesboro, Georgia; Division of Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, California; Advocate Heart Institute, Normal, Illinois; Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas; University Institute of Sports Medicine, Paracelsus Medical University, Austria; Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease, Stanford University, Stanford, California; Pediatric Cardiology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio; University of Herzzentrum, Zurich, Switzerland; Heart Center of Philadelphia, Jefferson University Hospitals, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Department of Cardiology, Hospital de Clinicas de Porte Allegre, Brazil; The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Institute of Sports Medicine and Science, Rome, Italy; and the Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, University of Padua Medical School, Italy.\n\nDr. Sharma has received grants from Cardiac Risk in the Young; and grants from British Heart Foundation, outside the submitted work.

Conversely, pathological LVH is commonly associated with additional ECG features such as T-wave inversion (TWI) in the inferior and lateral leads, ST-segment depression, and pathological Q waves (28,29). Therefore, the isolated presence of high QRS voltages fulfilling voltage criterion for LVH in the absence of other ECG or clinical markers suggestive of pathology are considered part of normal and training-related ECG changes in athletes and does not require further evaluation.\n\nVoltage criterion for right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) is also common in athletes with up to 13% of athletes fulfilling the Sokolow\u2013Lyon index (30,31). QRS voltages for RVH, when present in isolation, do not correlate with underlying pathology in athletes (31). Similar to voltage criteria for LVH, isolated QRS voltage for RVH is part of the normal spectrum of ECG in athletes and does not require further evaluation.\n\nEARLY REPOLARIZATION. Early repolarization is defined as elevation of the QRS-ST junction (J-point) by $ 0.1 mV often associated with a late QRS slurring or notching (J-wave) affecting the inferior and/or lateral leads (32\u201334). Early repolarization is common in healthy populations (2% to 44%) and is more prevalent in athletes, young individuals, males, and black ethnicity (32,35\u201339). Early repolarization consisting of J-point elevation with concave ST-segment elevation and a peaked TWI is present in up to 45% of Caucasian athletes and 63% to 91% of black athletes of African-Caribbean descent (hereto referred to as 'black' athletes) (22,30).\n\nSome studies on survivors of cardiac arrest and patients with primary ventricular fibrillation (VF) have suggested an association between early repolarization and the risk of VF (33,40). Although further studies are warranted to fully elucidate the mechanisms and prognostic implications of early repolarization in competitive athletes, to date there are no data to support an association between inferior early repolarization and SCD in athletes. Based on current evidence, all patterns of early repolarization, when present in isolation and without clinical markers of pathology, should be considered benign variants in athletes (41).\n\nREPOLARIZATION FINDINGS IN BLACK ATHLETES. Ethnicity is a major determinant of cardiac adaptation to exercise with more than two-thirds of black athletes exhibiting repolarization changes (29,30,42,43). Black athletes also commonly demonstrate a repolarization\n---\n International Recommendations for Electrocardiographic Interpretation\n\nFebruary 28, 2017: 1057-75\n\nAbnormal ECG findings in apletes\nThese ECG findings are unrelated to regular training or expected physiologic adaptation to exercise, may suggest pe presence of papologic cardiovascular disease, and require furper diagnostic investigation.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3271, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2f74b10-21c9-4b76-85ba-ffb179c70243": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2f74b10-21c9-4b76-85ba-ffb179c70243", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fbc25b47-a47e-4a56-ac9c-e2b826bdfe87", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "1a4aec3ed94ed994368e15c48ac5af90d0de9281ea3197b4be2b618060009240", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_fbc25b47-a47e-4a56-ac9c-e2b826bdfe87_22_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'ECG abnormality': {0: 'T wave inversion', 1: 'Anterior', 2: 'Lateral', 3: 'Inferolateral', 4: 'Inferior', 5: 'ST-segment depression', 6: 'Pathologic Q waves', 7: 'Complete left bundle branch block', 8: 'Profound nonspecific intra-ventricular conduction delay', 9: 'Epsilon wave', 10: 'Ventricular pre-excitation', 11: 'Prolonged QT interval*', 12: 'Brugada Type 1 pattern', 13: 'Profound sinus bradycardia', 14: 'Profound 1st-degree AV block', 15: 'Mobitz Type II 2nd-degree AV block', 16: '3rd-degree AV block', 17: 'Atrial tachyarrhythmias', 18: 'PVC', 19: 'Ventricular arrhythmias'}, 'Definition': {0: '$1 mm in depth in two or more contiguous leads; excludes leads aVR, III, and V1', 1: 'V2-V4 - excludes: black athletes with J-point elevation and convex ST-segment elevation followed by TWI in V2-V4; athletes age <16 with TWI in V1-V3; and biphasic T waves in only V3', 2: 'I and AVL, V5 and/or V6 (only one lead of TWI required in V5 or V6)', 3: 'II and aVF, V5-V6, I and AVL', 4: 'II and aVF', 5: '$0.5 mm in depth in two or more contiguous leads', 6: 'Q/R ratio $0.25 or $40 ms in duration in two or more leads (excluding III and aVR)', 7: 'QRS $120 ms, predominantly negative QRS complex in lead V1 (QS or rS), and upright notched or slurred R wave in leads I and V6', 8: 'Any QRS duration $140 ms', 9: 'Distinct low amplitude signal (small positive deflection or notch) between the end of the QRS complex and onset of the T-wave in leads V1-V3', 10: 'PR interval <120 ms with a delta wave (slurred upstroke in the QRS complex) and wide QRS ($120 ms)', 11: 'QTc $470 ms (male) QTc $480 ms (female) QTc $500 ms (marked QT prolongation)', 12: 'Coved pattern: initial ST-segment elevation $2 mm (high take-off) with downsloping ST-segment elevation followed by a negative symmetric T-wave in $1 leads in V1-V3', 13: '<30 beats/min or sinus pauses $3 s', 14: '$400 ms', 15: 'Intermittently non-conducted P waves with a fixed PR interval', 16: 'Complete heart block', 17: 'Supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter', 18: '$2 PVCs per 10 s tracing', 19: 'Couplets, triplets, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia'}}", "table_summary": "This table provides instructions on how to measure the T-wave in an electrocardiogram.

These ECG findings have been categorized as 'borderline' findings in athletes.\n\n AXIS DEVIATION AND VOLTAGE CRITERIA FOR ATRIAL ENLARGEMENT\n\nAxis deviation and voltage criteria for atrial enlargement account for >40% of abnormal ECG patterns in athletes but do not correlate with cardiac pathology. In a large study of 2,533 athletes age 14 to 35 years old and 9,997 controls of similar age, echocardiographic evaluation of the 579 athletes and controls with isolated axis deviation or voltage criteria for atrial enlargement failed to identify any major structural or functional abnormalities.\n\n COMPLETE RIGHT BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCK\n\nAlthough incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) is common in young athletes, the significance of complete RBBB is less certain. Complete RBBB is detected in approximately 1% of the general population and large datasets in young adult athletes reveal a prevalence of 0.5% to 2.5%. In a study of 510 U.S. collegiate athletes, RBBB was reported in 2.5% and compared with athletes with normal QRS complexes or incomplete RBBB, athletes with complete RBBB exhibited larger right ventricular dimensions and a lower right ventricular ejection fraction but preserved fractional area change. None of the athletes with complete RBBB or incomplete RBBB was found to have pathological structural cardiac disease. These patterns among trained athletes could represent a spectrum of structural and physiological cardiac remodeling characterized by RV dilation with resultant QRS prolongation and a relative reduction in the RV systolic function at rest.\n---\n Table 2: Evaluation of Electrocardiographic Abnormalities", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2748, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d07a1aa-6144-446a-991c-2baa47d5d8e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d07a1aa-6144-446a-991c-2baa47d5d8e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fbc25b47-a47e-4a56-ac9c-e2b826bdfe87", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "1a4aec3ed94ed994368e15c48ac5af90d0de9281ea3197b4be2b618060009240", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_fbc25b47-a47e-4a56-ac9c-e2b826bdfe87_38_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "|ECG Abnormality|Potential Cardiac Disease*|Recommended Evaluation\u2020|Considerations|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|T-wave inversion in the lateral or inferolateral leads|- HCM", "table_summary": "This table provides recommendations for evaluating various cardiac abnormalities such as atrioventricular block, atrial tachyarrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias, and borderline ECG findings.

Temporary restriction from athletic activity should be considered for athletes with abnormal ECGs of uncertain clinical significance until secondary investigations are completed.\n\n ABNORMAL T-WAVE INVERSION\n\nTWI $1 mm in depth in two or more contiguous leads (excluding leads aVR, III, and V 1) in an anterior, lateral, inferolateral, or inferior territory is abnormal and should prompt further evaluation for underlying structural heart disease (Tables 1 and 2). Normal exceptions include TWI confined to leads V 1\u2013V 4 in black athletes when preceded by J point and/or ST-segment elevation, and TWI in leads V 1\u2013V 3 in athletes aged <16 years.\n\n CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe relationship between abnormal TWI and several forms of structural heart disease is well documented (56). TWI in the inferior or lateral leads is common in HCM (56\u201359). Whereas TWI in the right precordial leads (V 1to V 3) or beyond in the absence of a complete RBBB is common in ARVC (Figure 4D) (60,61).\n\nThere are no data relating to the significance of flat or biphasic T-waves in athletes but similar to TWI, this panel would recommend further evaluation of biphasic T-waves where the negative portion is $1 mm in depth in $2 leads.\n\nEvaluation. Lateral or inferolateral T-wave inversion. There is mounting evidence that TWI in the lateral or inferolateral leads is associated with the presence of quiescent cardiomyopathy in a considerable proportion of athletes (30,62\u201364). Recommendations for the evaluation of abnormal TWI and other clinical considerations are presented in Table 2.\n\nTWI affecting the lateral leads (V 5 to V 6, I and aVL) should prompt a comprehensive investigation to exclude cardiomyopathy. If echocardiography is not diagnostic, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium should be utilized. Cardiac MRI provides superior assessment of myocardial hypertrophy, especially the left ventricular apex and the lateral free wall and may also demonstrate late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), a non-specific marker suggesting myocardial fibrosis. If cardiac MRI is not available, echocardiography with contrast should be considered. Exercise ECG testing and Holter monitoring also should be considered in the evaluation of lateral or inferolateral TWI, especially for athletes with 'grey zone' hypertrophy (males with maximal LV wall thickness 13 to 16 mm) without LGE, where the diagnosis of HCM remains uncertain. In such cases, the presence of ventricular tachycardia during exercise or Holter may support HCM and is also useful in risk stratification (65).\n\nFor athletes with lateral or inferolateral TWI, regular follow-up with serial cardiac imaging is necessary even when the initial evaluation is normal, in order to monitor for the development of a cardiomyopathy phenotype (62,63).\n\n Anterior T-wave inversion\n\nAnterior TWI is a normal variant in asymptomatic adolescent athletes age <16 years, in black athletes when preceded by J-point elevation and convex ST-segment elevation, and in some endurance athletes (66,67).

A large study of over 14,000 white adults age 16 to 35 years old, including over 2,500 apletes showed pat anterior TWI had a prevalence of 2.3% (68). Anterior TWI was more common in females and apletes and was confined to leads V1 to V2 in almost all individuals, and only exceeded beyond V2 in 1% of females and 0.2% of males (68). None of pe individuals wip anterior TWI were diagnosed wip a cardiomyopapy following comprehensive investigation indicating pat pis particular ECG pattern is non-specific in low-risk populations. Based on pis report, it is justifiable to only investigate non-black apletes wip anterior TWI beyond V2 in pe absence of oper clinical or electrical features of ARVC.\nSpecific information about pe J-point and preceding ST-segment may help differentiate between physiological adaptation and cardiomyopapy in apletes wip anterior TWI affecting leads V3 and/or V4. A recent study comparing anterior TWI in a series of black and white healpy apletes, and patients wip HCM and ARVC, showed pat in apletes wip anterior TWI, in most non-black apletes age \u2265 16 years, anterior TWI beyond lead V2 should prompt furper evaluation given pe potential overlap wip ARVC. In pese apletes, concurrent findings of J-point elevation, ST-segment elevation, or biphasic T waves more likely represents aplete\u2019s heart, while pe absence of J-point elevation or a coexistent depressed ST-segment is more concerning for ARVC (Figure 5) (66).\nOper ECG findings suggestive of ARVC include low limb lead voltages, prolonged S wave upstroke, ventricular ectopy wip LBBB morphology, and epsilon waves (61). A combination of tests is needed to diagnose ARVC including echocardiography, cardiac MRI, Holter monitoring, exercise ECG test, and signal averaged ECG.\n---\n International Recommendations for Electrocardiographic Interpretation\n\nFigure 3: Anterior Repolarization Changes in a Black Athlete", "start_char_idx": 3820, "end_char_idx": 7207, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "052e9ccb-ce7a-45fd-b193-4a98ae483df5": {"__data__": {"id_": "052e9ccb-ce7a-45fd-b193-4a98ae483df5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fbc25b47-a47e-4a56-ac9c-e2b826bdfe87", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "1a4aec3ed94ed994368e15c48ac5af90d0de9281ea3197b4be2b618060009240", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_fbc25b47-a47e-4a56-ac9c-e2b826bdfe87_90_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{' ': {0: 'Dev:', 1: ' ', 2: ' '}, 'aVR': {0: 'Speed: 25 m/sec', 1: ' ', 2: ' '}, ' .1': {0: 'Limb: 10 mmV', 1: ' ', 2: ' '}, 'V6': {0: 'Chest: 10 mm', 1: '60-150 Hz', 2: 'PHO90A'}}", "table_summary": "Table providing recommendations for comprehensive cardiac testing based on specific conditions and symptoms.,\nwith the following table title:\nCardiac Testing Recommendations,\nwith the following columns:\n- Condition/Symptom: None\n- Testing Recommendation: None\n", "file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "a47e5cbb11c1e5ef5073ec9638769ea2a847afa71851bdaf31aedb665c5b4447", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_fbc25b47-a47e-4a56-ac9c-e2b826bdfe87_94_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Normal ECG Findings\nType: Abnormal ECG Findings\nSummary: None", "file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "9ae106deb557ac323383c0048740f528911e734cf6596ef9b0f4feb38139d564", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Electrocardiogram from a black athlete demonstrating voltage criterion for left ventricular hypertrophy, J-point elevation, and convex (\u2018domed\u2019) ST-segment elevation followed by T-wave inversion in V1 to V4 (circles). This is a normal repolarization pattern in black athletes.\n\nInferior T-wave inversion. The significance of TWI confined to the inferior leads is unknown. However, this finding cannot be attributed to physiological remodeling and thus warrants further investigation with, at minimum, an echocardiogram. Cardiac MRI should be considered based on the echocardiographic findings or clinical suspicion.\n\nST-SEGMENT DEPRESSION. While ST-segment depression is common among patients with cardiomyopathy, it is not a feature of athletic training. ST-segment depression (relative to the isoelectric PR segment) in excess of 0.05 mV (0.5 mm) in two or more leads should be considered an abnormal finding requiring definitive evaluation for underlying structural heart disease.\n\nEvaluation. Echocardiography is the minimum evaluation for athletes with ST-segment depression to investigate for underlying cardiomyopathy. Cardiac MRI should be considered based on the echocardiographic findings or clinical suspicion.\n\nPATHOLOGICAL Q WAVES. Several pathological disorders including HCM, ARVC, infiltrative myocardial diseases, accessory pathways, and transmural myocardial infarction can lead to the development of pathological Q waves. Pathological Q waves have been reported in approximately 1% to 2% of all athletes, and may be higher in males and black athletes. For asymptomatic athletes, pathological Q waves were previously defined as >3 mm in depth or >40 ms in duration in two or more leads (except III and aVR). In practice, however, this criterion is a common source of false positive ECG results as trained athletes with physiological LVH and thin adolescent athletes may have increased precordial voltages and deep lateral or inferior Q waves.\n\nThe use of a Q/R ratio overcomes some of these issues by normalizing Q wave depth to the degree of proceeding R-wave voltage. Case control analyses of athletes and HCM patients suggest that this will decrease the false positive rate without compromising sensitivity for the detection of cardiomyopathy. Thus, this consensus panel has modified the definition for pathological Q waves.\n---\n Sharma et al.\n\nInternational Recommendations for Electrocardiographic Interpretation\n\nFebruary 28, 2017: 1057-75", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2464, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6f940d3-eccd-4b84-9dc2-1126bf7f1638": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6f940d3-eccd-4b84-9dc2-1126bf7f1638", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fbc25b47-a47e-4a56-ac9c-e2b826bdfe87", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "1a4aec3ed94ed994368e15c48ac5af90d0de9281ea3197b4be2b618060009240", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_fbc25b47-a47e-4a56-ac9c-e2b826bdfe87_94_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "|FIGURE 4 Normal and Abnormal Patterns of T-Wave Inversion|\n|---|\n|(A) Anterior T-wave inversion in V1 to V3 in a 12-year-old asymptomatic athlete without a family history of sudden cardiac death considered a normal 'juvenile' pattern.|(D)|\n|(B) T-wave inversion in V1 to V4 in a 17-year-old asymptomatic mixed race (Middle-Eastern/black) athlete without a family history of sudden cardiac death.

In asymptomatic athletes with profound non-specific IVCD, an echocardiogram is recommended to evaluate for myocardial disease. Other testing may be indicated depending on echocardiographic findings or clinical suspicion.\n\nPROFOUND NON-SPECIFIC INTRA-VENTRICULAR VENTRICULAR PRE-EXCITATION. Ventricular pre-excitation occurs when an accessory pathway bypasses the AV node resulting in abnormal conduction to the ventricle (pre-excitation) with shortening of the PR interval and widening of the QRS. This is evident on the ECG as the Wolf\u2013Parkinson\u2013White (WPW) pattern defined as a PR interval <120 ms, the presence of a delta wave (slurring of the initial QRS), and a QRS duration >120 ms. The WPW pattern occurs in up to 1 in 250 athletes. The presence of an accessory pathway can predispose an athlete to sudden death because rapid conduction of atrial fibrillation across the accessory pathway can result in VF.\n\nEvaluation. A short PR interval in isolation without a widened QRS or delta wave in an asymptomatic athlete should not be considered for further assessment. The WPW pattern warrants further assessment of the\n---\n Sharma et al.\n\nJACC VOL.69, NO.8, 2017 International Recommendations for Electrocardiographic Interpretation FEBRUARY 28, 2017: 1057-75\n\nrefractory period of the accessory pathway. Non-invasive risk stratification begins with an exercise stress test, where abrupt, complete loss of pre-excitation at higher heart rates suggests a low-risk accessory pathway (83,84). An echocardiogram also should be considered due to the association of WPW with Ebstein\u2019s anomaly and cardiomyopathy. Intermittent pre-excitation during sinus rhythm on a resting ECG is also consistent with a low-risk pathway and may obviate the need for an exercise test (85). If non-invasive testing cannot confirm a low-risk pathway or is inconclusive, an electrophysiological study should be considered to determine the shortest pre-excited RR interval during atrial fibrillation (83). If the shortest pre-excited RR interval is #250 ms (240 beats/min), then the accessory pathway is deemed high risk and transcatheter ablation is recommended (83,86). Some physicians may choose to subject all competitive athletes involved in moderate or high-intensity sport to electrophysiological studies irrespective of the results of the exercise test or 24 h ECG on the premise that high catecholamine concentrations during very intensive exercise may modify the refractory period of an accessory pathway in a fashion that cannot be reproduced during laboratory tests.\n\nPROLONGED QT INTERVAL. Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a potentially lethal, genetically mediated ventricular arrhythmia syndrome with the hallmark electrocardiographic feature of QT prolongation. LQTS is estimated to affect 1 in 2,000 individuals, and this may be underestimated given the subpopulation of so-called 'normal QT interval' or 'concealed' LQTS (87). Autopsy negative sudden unexplained death represents 25% to 40% of sudden unexpected deaths in persons under age 40 years (3,88-90). In such cases, cardiac ion channelopathies have been implicated by post-mortem genetic testing as the probable cause in up to 25% to 40% of cases (91-94).\n\nCalculating the corrected QT interval. Accurate measurement and manual confirmation of the computer-derived QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) is critical as the accuracy of computer-generated QTc values is about 90% to 95%. Studies have suggested the ability of cardiologists to accurately measure the QTc is suboptimal (95). However, accurate assessment of the QTc can be achieved by adhering to the following six principles (96):\n\n1. Use Bazett\u2019s heart rate correction formula (QTc = QT/RR; note the RR interval is measured in seconds) as population-based QTc distributions most frequently use Bazett-derived QTc values (97).\n2. Bazett\u2019s formula underestimates the QTc at heart rates <50 beats/min, and overestimates the QTc at heart rates >90 beats/min. Accordingly, for a heart rate <50 beats/min, a repeat ECG after mild aerobic activity is recommended to achieve a heart rate closer to 60 beats/min.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4409, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a02b006b-4420-471d-a0a3-a279b18be432": {"__data__": {"id_": "a02b006b-4420-471d-a0a3-a279b18be432", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fbc25b47-a47e-4a56-ac9c-e2b826bdfe87", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "1a4aec3ed94ed994368e15c48ac5af90d0de9281ea3197b4be2b618060009240", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dfde73cc-8bc6-4bce-b694-8be679ea3ead", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "7f088e6d1af7a5f9107fc15b028b78c0cbb871fc1c864eaf8497a227ec6b205c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_fbc25b47-a47e-4a56-ac9c-e2b826bdfe87_104_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "", "file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "4f452789afa351f23d5f11a7ce2de6090caf5d4527ea7cef3ffe962b4484f647", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Studies have suggested the ability of cardiologists to accurately measure the QTc is suboptimal (95).

For heart rates >90 beats/min, a repeat ECG after additional resting time may help achieve a lower heart rate.\n3. If sinus arrhythmia is present with beat to beat variation in heart rate, an average QT interval and average RR interval should be used.\n4. Leads II and V 5 usually provide the best delineation of the T-wave.\n5. Low amplitude U waves, which are common in the anterior precordial leads, should not be included in the QT calculation. The 'Teach-the-Tangent' or 'Avoid-the-Tail' method to delineate the end of the T-wave should be followed (Figure 6) (96).\n6. The morphology of the T-wave, not just the length of the QT interval, also can suggest the presence of LQTS (98). For instance, a notched T-wave in the lateral precordial leads where the amplitude of the second portion of the T-wave following the notch is greater than the first portion of the T-wave may represent LQT-2 even in the absence of overt QT prolongation.\n\nThe easiest and most efficient way to confirm the computer-derived QTc is to examine lead II and/or V 5 and determine if the manually measured QT interval matches the computer\u2019s QT measurement. If there is concordance within about 10 ms, one can trust that the computer can derive accurately an average RR interval and complete the Bazett\u2019s calculation. If, however, the manually measured QT interval is >10 ms different than the computer\u2019s QT measurement, an average RR interval should be determined and the QTc recalculated using the Bazett\u2019s formula.\n\nCorrected QTc cut-offs. Given the overlap between QTc distributions in population-derived cohorts of healthy individuals compared with patients with genetically confirmed LQTS, the QTc cut-off value compelling further evaluation must be chosen carefully to balance the frequency of abnormal results and the positive predictive value for LQTS.\n\nRecent consensus statements on ECG interpretation in athletes have recommended that male athletes with a QTc \u2265470 ms and female athletes with a QTc \u2265480 ms undergo further evaluation for LQTS to better balance false positive and false negative findings (6,10). These cut-off values are around the 99th percentile and consistent with thresholds defined by the American Heart Association and\n---\n International Recommendations for Electrocardiographic Interpretation\n\nFigure 6: This Figure Illustrates the \u2018Teach-the-Tangent\u2019 or \u2018Avoid-the-Tail\u2019 Method for Manual Measurement of the QT Interval", "start_char_idx": 3728, "end_char_idx": 6840, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "818eed90-4cd6-4e62-8f77-17aec4b46c08": {"__data__": {"id_": "818eed90-4cd6-4e62-8f77-17aec4b46c08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fbc25b47-a47e-4a56-ac9c-e2b826bdfe87", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "1a4aec3ed94ed994368e15c48ac5af90d0de9281ea3197b4be2b618060009240", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c2d2320b-958b-4468-9c48-7fea2ad12197", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_name": "International Recommendations for ECG Interpretation in Athletes.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7396188, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "e12222b32cac574c50b88ed7d80b56f56f91aea1ac372aa2a7f43c3f5e23e8ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_fbc25b47-a47e-4a56-ac9c-e2b826bdfe87_104_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'V1': {0: 'A straight line is drawn on the downslope of the T-wave to the point of intersection with the isoelectric line.

This consensus group also recommends QTc values of 460 to 570 ms. A QTc of <500 ms in the absence of symptoms or familial disease was unlikely to represent LQTS. In contrast, a QTc >500 ms was highly suggestive of LQTS as all three athletes with a QTc value of >500 ms exhibited one of paradoxical prolongation of the QTc during exercise, a confirmatory genetic mutation, or prolonged QTc in a first-degree relative (101).\n\nShort QT interval.

Data from over 18,000 asymptomatic young British individuals found that the prevalence of a QTc <320 ms is 0.1%; suggesting an abnormal cut-off value of <320 ms is pragmatic (100).

Although multiple PVCs are usually benign, their presence may be the hallmark of underlying heart disease (111,112). PVCs originating from the right ventricular outflow tract (LBBB and inferior axis origin) are considered particularly benign when associated with a normal ECG, however this PVC morphology can also be present in patients with early ARVC particularly when the QRS exceeds 160 ms (113). Therefore, the finding of $2 PVCs on an ECG should prompt more extensive evaluation to exclude underlying structural heart disease. Evaluation. The extent of evaluation for $2 PVCs is controversial and excluding pathology may be difficult.

The international consensus standards presented on ECG interpretation and the evaluation of ECG abnormalities serve as an important foundation for improving the quality of cardiovascular care of athletes. As new scientific data become available, revision of these recommendations may be necessary to further advance the accuracy of ECG interpretation in the athletic population.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The 2nd Summit on Electrocardiogram Interpretation in Athletes was sponsored by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM), the FIFA Medical Assessment and Research Center (F-MARC), and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

Its purpose is to foster understanding of how the modern ECG is derived and displayed and to establish standards that will improve the accuracy and usefulness of the ECG in practice. Derivation of representative waveforms and measurements based on global intervals are described. Special emphasis is placed on digital signal acquisition and computer-based signal processing, which provide automated measurements that lead to computer-generated diagnostic statements. Lead placement, recording methods, and waveform presentation are reviewed. Throughout the statement, recommendations for ECG standards are placed in context of the clinical implications of evolving ECG technology.

It is indispensable for the diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes and is the most accurate means of diagnosing intraventricular conduction disturbances and arrhythmias. Its interpretation may lead to the recognition of electrolyte abnormalities, particularly of serum potassium and calcium, and permit the detection of some forms of genetically mediated electrical or structural cardiac abnormalities. The ECG is routinely used to monitor patients treated with antiarrhythmic and other drugs, in the preoperative assessment of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, and in screening individuals in high-risk occupations and, in some\n\nOther members of the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram Writing Group include Mark Josephson, MD, FACC, FHRS; Jay W.

As a research tool, it is used in long-term population-based surveillance studies and in experimental trials of drugs with recognized or potential cardiac effects. Indications for use of the ECG were summarized in a joint American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology report in 1992. Because of its broad applicability, the accurate recording and precise interpretation of the ECG are critical. The establishment of and adherence to professionally developed and endorsed evidence-based standards for all phases of the ECG procedure is an important step in ensuring the high level of precision required and expected by clinicians and their patients. However, there has not been a comprehensive updating of ECG standards and criteria since 1978. Since 1978, there have been many advances in the technology of electrocardiography; in the understanding of the anatomic, pathological, electrophysiological, and genetic information underlying ECG findings; and in the clinical correlations of ECG abnormalities. One of the most important changes in electrocardiography is the widespread use of computerized systems for storage and analysis. Many if not most ECGs in the United States now are recorded by digital, automated machines equipped with software that measures ECG intervals and amplitudes, provides a virtually instantaneous interpretation, and often compares the tracing to those recorded earlier by the same system. However, different automated systems may have different technical specifications that result in significant differences in the measurement of amplitudes, intervals, and diagnostic statements.\n\nFor these reasons, the AHA initiated an updating of guideline statements for standardization and interpretation of the ECG. The project has been endorsed by the American College of Cardiology, the Heart Rhythm Society, and the International Society for Computerized Electrocardiology. The purposes of this project are as follows: (1) to review the status of techniques currently used to record and interpret the ECG and to identify opportunities for modification; (2) to simplify and unify the various descriptive, diagnostic, and modifying terminologies currently used in order to create a common and more easily applied lexicon; and (3) to identify the weaknesses of the descriptive, interpretative, and comparative algorithms and recommend changes that incorporate the newly recognized factors referred to above.\n\nThe chairman (L.S.G.) was selected by the Electrocardiography and Arrhythmias Committee of the Council on Clinical Cardiology of the AHA. He formed an advisory group to assist in setting goals and to recommend other writing group members. The committee met on 5 occasions to discuss goals, identify specific areas that required updating, and review progress. A smaller working/writing group with a group leader was chosen for each topic. This is the first of 6 articles written in response to the AHA mandate. It is followed by a glossary of descriptive, diagnostic, and comparative statements that attempts to minimize repetitive and noninformative statements. Additional articles, to be published subsequently, will discuss the ECG interpretation of intraventricular conduction disturbances, abnormalities of ventricular repolarization, hypertrophy, and ischemia/infarction.\n---\n 1308 Circulation March 13, 2007\n\nThe ECG Signal and Its Processing the heart.

The QRS of infants often contains important components as high as 250 Hz. The fundamental frequency of T waves is approximately 1 to 2 Hz. Filtering of the ECG signal to within the band between 1 to 30 Hz produces a stable ECG that is generally free of artifact, but this bandwidth is unacceptable for diagnostic recording because it produces distortions of both high- and low-frequency components of the signal. The high-frequency components of the ECG signal define the most rapidly changing parts of the signal, including Q waves and notched components within the QRS complex. Because QRS amplitude measurement depends on accurate detection of the peak of an R wave, an inadequate high-frequency response results in systematic underestimation of signal amplitude and in smoothing of notches and Q waves. On the other hand, an inadequate low-frequency response can result in important distortions of repolarization. Accordingly, the transfer functions of the filtering algorithms of analog and digital electrocardiographs have a major effect on the resulting ECG.\n\n The ECG Signal\n\nThe standard 12-lead ECG records potential differences between prescribed sites on the body surface that vary during the cardiac cycle; it reflects differences in transmembrane voltages in myocardial cells that occur during depolarization and repolarization within each cycle. The ECG was regarded by Einthoven et al as originating in a stationary, time-dependent single-dipole source that can be represented by a vector, the heart vector. In this model, voltage in any lead was explained by projection of the heart vector onto the straight line that defined the lead axis. Burger et al expanded this concept by treating the lead axes as vectors. A lead vector, in addition to having a direction that is not the same as that of the lead axis, also has a length. Voltage in a lead is not merely the projection of the heart vector on the lead axis but also its projection on the lead vector times the length (ie, the \u201cstrength\u201d) of the lead vector. Direction and strength of a lead vector depend on the geometry of the body and on the varying electric impedances of the tissues in the torso. Pairs of electrodes (or a combination of electrodes serving as 1 of the 2 electrodes) and the tracings that result from their use are known as leads. Placement of electrodes on the torso is distinct from direct placement on the heart, because the localized signal strength that occurs with direct electrode contact is markedly attenuated and altered by torso inhomogeneities that include thoracic tissue boundaries and variations in impedance. At any point in time, the electrical activity of the heart is composed of differently directed forces. Accordingly, the potential at any point on the body surface represents the instantaneous uncanceled electrical forces of the heart, where cancellation also is dependent on torso inhomogeneities. For further reading, see the comprehensive analysis of lead theory by Horacek in 1989. electrodes move farther away from the heart, signal strength decreases together with lead strength. According to solid angle theory, signal magnitude can be related to both spatial and nonspatial factors. Nonspatial factors include the magnitude of transmembrane potential difference across a boundary within the heart. Spatial factors include the projected boundary of the difference in potential relative to the area of a sphere of unit size; this will increase with the absolute size of the area but decrease with distance of the electrode from the heart.\n\n ECG Signal Processing\n\nProcessing of the ECG signal by a digital electrocardiograph involves initial sampling of the signal from electrodes on the body surface. Next, the digital ECG must eliminate or suppress low-frequency noise that results from baseline wander, movement, and respiration and higher-frequency noise that results from muscle artifact and power-line or radiated electromagnetic interference. As a result, the ECG signal at the body surface must be filtered and amplified by the electrocardiograph. Digital filters can be designed to have linear phase characteristics, and this avoids some of the distortion introduced by classic analog filters. Once filtered, individual templates are constructed for each lead from data sampled generally from dominant complexes, from which amplitude and duration measurements are made. Global measurements are made from individual lead data or from mathematical combinations of simultaneously acquired individual lead data. Measurement error has an important effect on the accuracy of ECG diagnostic statements. Reference is made to the comprehensive analysis of technical factors that affect the ECG by Zywietz.

In the present statement, factors that affect the processing of the ECG signal will be discussed in terms of technology, clinical implications, and recommendations.\n\n Sampling of the ECG Signal\n\nTechnology Direct-writing electrocardiographs, which were preponderant until the 1970s, recorded signals that were analog, that is, continuous, in nature. Nearly all current-generation ECG machines convert the analog ECG signal to digital form before further processing. Analog-to-digital conversion in modern digital ECGs generally occurs at the front end, such as\n---\n Kligfield et al Standardization and Interpretation of the ECG, Part I\n\nas the lead cable module. The initial sampling rate during introduces considerable distortion into the ECG, particularly with respect to the level of the ST segment. 39,40 This distortion results from phase nonlinearities that occur in areas of the ECG signal where frequency content and wave amplitude change abruptly, as occurs where the end of the QRS complex meets the ST segment. Digital filtering provides methods for increasing the low-frequency cutoff without the introduction of phase distortion. 23 This can be accomplished with a bidirectional filter by a second filtering pass that is applied in reverse time, 41 that is, from the end of the T wave to the onset of the P wave. This approach can be applied to ECG signals that are stored in computer memory, but it is not possible to achieve continuous real-time monitoring without a time lag. Alternatively, a zero phase shift can be achieved with a flat step response filter, 42 which allows the reduction of baseline drift without low-frequency distortion.\n\n Clinical Implications\n\nThe initial sampling rate used by the computer to transform the analog electrical signal to a series of discrete digital points (generally described in the unit of samples per second, or imprecisely as a sampling rate of x Hz) is most often many times greater than required for further processing of the ECG signal. This is known as \u201coversampling.\u201d Pacemaker stimulus outputs are generally shorter in duration than 0.5 ms, and therefore, they cannot be reliably detected by ordinary signal processing technique at 500 to 1000 Hz. Accordingly, a primary benefit of oversampling is the detection of narrow pacemaker pulses. Pacemaker detection is not reliably or accurately performed in all current systems. Oversampling can also improve signal quality at the high-frequency cutoff. Separate from difficulties caused by pacemaker spike duration, the very small amplitudes of modern bipolar pacemaker stimulus outputs are often too small to be recognized on the standard ECG, a problem that requires resolution without introducing artificially enhanced pacemaker signals into the necessary for coherent alignment of the sequential complexes tracing.\n\n Recommendations\n\nOversampling by a significant multiple of the upper-frequency cutoff is recommended to provide recommended bandwidth in the digitized signal. Manufacturers should continue to develop improved algorithms for the identification and quantitative presentation of pacemaker stimulus outputs and for their preservation during ECG storage and retrieval. Low-amplitude pacemaker stimulus outputs should not be artificially increased in amplitude to aid recognition, because this would distort the form of the recorded ECG. Instead, it is recommended that manufacturers incorporate a separate representation of detected pacemaker stimulus outputs into 1 row only of the standard output tracing that would aid the identification of atrial, ventricular, and biventricular pacing signals. The selected row might be a rhythm strip that accompanies the standard 3 rows of lead signals in 4 columns, or in the absence of a rhythm row, 1 of the standard rows might be selected for this purpose.\n\n Low-Frequency Filtering Technology\n\nThe heart rate, in beats (cycles) per minute (bpm), when divided by 60 (seconds per minute) forms a lower bound for the frequency content in Hertz (Hz, cycles per second). In practice, this is unlikely to be lower than 0.5 Hz, which corresponds to a heart rate of 30 bpm; heart rates below 40 bpm (0.67 Hz) are uncommon in practice. 23 However, with traditional analog filtering, a 0.5-Hz low-frequency cutoff corresponds to a heart rate of 30 bpm; heart rates below 40 bpm (0.67 Hz) are uncommon in practice.", "start_char_idx": 4226, "end_char_idx": 9357, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5f182e8-2594-4c08-9acf-cf2d1b45f44f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5f182e8-2594-4c08-9acf-cf2d1b45f44f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed9058a2-5008-4b21-9070-0507ada1c7fb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "de36ba1ac85299643cfebe5a836adb4da9485531ba46fd1c1f56ebd2496ea902", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bbeaffbc-141a-45b2-9d70-447deebd84ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "da5a0cee8be90954c6ccea77da33a37bfd32a278eeccdd41058f1d0aec41370d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "224129ca-a513-48dc-9cc4-de989114f8ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "874195fd79a8e59eba3f0ff762af45e001afc869e12a2cad96a0544a7264077a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The selected row might be a rhythm strip that accompanies the standard 3 rows of lead signals in 4 columns, or in the absence of a rhythm row, 1 of the standard rows might be selected for this purpose.\n\n Low-Frequency Filtering Technology\n\nThe heart rate, in beats (cycles) per minute (bpm), when divided by 60 (seconds per minute) forms a lower bound for the frequency content in Hertz (Hz, cycles per second).

Accordingly, the ANSI/AAMI standards recommend using the largest-amplitude deflection in each lead as representative of the magnitude for that measurement. Measurements from digitized records are more reproducible than those from analog tracings. Digital electrocardiographs can reduce or eliminate unwanted beat-to-beat variations within leads by forming \u201ctemplates\u201d for individual leads that serve as representative complexes. Willems et al have shown that programs that analyzed an averaged beat showed significantly less variability than programs that measured every complex or a selected beat; similar findings have been reported by Zywietz and colleagues. Single-lead average or median-complex templates may be derived from selected, accurately aligned complexes. One algorithm combines techniques to use the median values of several averaged cycles. Methods vary for the accurate alignment of normal PQRST complexes for these purposes but generally involve template matching and cross-correlation algorithms that exclude non-dominant waveforms. Alignment is critical to the success of the measurement process that follows template formation. Noise, measured as RMS (root mean square) residual error in aligned representative complexes, can affect measurements of duration and compromise the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity for infarction criteria, among other diagnoses. Residual error is reduced by incorporation of more complexes into the representative complex. Zywietz has demonstrated that noise levels in constructed complexes can be reduced to below 5 \u00b5V to allow deflections of 20 \u00b5V to be estimated with no more than 10% error. However, not all variability between complexes is due to noise, and a study using the CSE database has suggested that the diagnostic value of a representative complex may be improved under some circumstances by consideration of the classification of individual complexes. Although fidelity standards for other ECG features are contained in the 1990 AHA document, no fidelity standard exists for accuracy of representative beat construction.\n\nClinical Implications The higher the frequencies contained in the filtered signal, the more accurate will be the measurement of rapid upstroke velocity, peak amplitude, and waves of small duration. Inadequate high-frequency response reduces the amplitude of QRS measurements and the ability to detect small deflections. Because digital ECGs have a temporal resolution in milliseconds and an amplitude resolution in microvolts, recommendations for the high-frequency response of ECGs have evolved over the years. A high-frequency cutoff of 100 Hz was considered adequate by the AHA in 1975 to maintain diagnostic accuracy during visual inspection of direct-writing tracings by electrocardiographers. Even so, it has long been recognized that higher-frequency components of the QRS complex are present and that these components may have clinical significance in patients with various forms of heart disease. To measure routine durations and amplitudes accurately in adults, adolescents, and children, an upper-frequency cutoff of at least 150 Hz is required; an upper-frequency cutoff of 250 Hz is more appropriate for infants. An obvious consequence of these high-frequency recommendations is that reduction of noise by setting the high-frequency cutoff of a standard or monitoring ECG to 40 Hz will invalidate any amplitude measurements used for diagnostic classification.\n\nRecommendations The ANSI/AAMI standard of 1991, reaffirmed in 2001, recommended a high-frequency cutoff of at least 150 Hz for all standard 12-lead ECGs. The ANSI/AAMI document also details maximum allowable errors for individual determinants of overall input signal reproduction, which extend beyond the scope of the present report but are important guidelines for manufacturers.

Temporal superposition of complexes permits the earliest onset and latest offset of waveforms to be identified for measurement of intervals that are more accurate than can be obtained from single leads. This can be done by searching for the earliest and latest time points of rapid voltage change across temporally aligned individual complexes. Alternatively, a spatial vector magnitude may be created for multiple leads, as exemplified for 3 leads by (x \u0005y \u0005z ) , and fiducial points may be determined from this magnitude function. An equally useful function can be derived as |\u0006x|\u0005|\u0006y|\u0005|\u0006z|, where \u0006x is the amplitude difference between 2 consecutive samples in lead x, etc, which is a spatial velocity function. When only several selected representative complexes are included in the global measurement, intervals may still be underestimated if earliest onset and latest offset times are not detected. Conversely, global measurements may overstate intervals by inclusion of single-lead information that would not be visually accepted by a human overreader. Differences in measurements may also result from differences in the method of lead alignment or template formation and from differences in definition of waveform onset and offset by different algorithms of different manufacturers. The importance of this phenomenon is seen in determination of the QT interval, where different approaches to definition of T-wave offset can confound reproducibility. 58,59It is in this context that differences in ECG measurement performance of different computer-assisted analysis programs must be placed. 15,17| |\n|Clinical Implications| |\n|The capability for simultaneous 12-lead data acquisition by modern digital electrocardiographs obligates major reconsideration of measurement standards and reference values for intervals that were originally derived from analog, single-channel recordings. When the vector orientation of any lead is approximately perpendicular to the heart vector during the initial or terminal portion of an ECG waveform, an isoelectric component of the initial or terminal component of the waveform will be recorded in that lead at that time. Because there can be no accurate time alignment of leads in single-channel recordings, duration measurements from individual leads will in most cases fail to detect the earliest onset or the latest offset of waveforms. As a result, measurements from single leads will systematically underestimate durations of components of the PQRST complex. 21 Simple demonstration of this phenomenon is seen in the measurement of QT| |", "table_summary": "This table provides information about various reviewers, their affiliations, and any industry relationships they have, such as research grants, support, and consultancy roles.,\nwith the following table title:\nReviewer Affiliations and Industry Relationships,\nwith the following columns:\n- Reviewer: None\n- Employment: None\n- Research Grant: None\n- Research Support: None\n- Speakers' Bureau/Honoraria: None\n- Ownership Interest: None\n- Consultant/Advisory Board: None\n- Other: None\n", "file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "459a01311aedeaf2686f4ff6f2bfef170db1ec0af0e12cec9929f7fb0719156d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_ed9058a2-5008-4b21-9070-0507ada1c7fb_26_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Technology\nType: string\nSummary: None", "file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "25c478f9e3f1cbeaf916188d62fb833085a2343fdc7545cef05f5b9e4dbd8e0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Recommendations\n\nGlobal measurements of intervals should be obtained from time-coherent data in multiple leads to detect the earliest onset and latest offset of waveforms. For routine purposes, global measurements of P-wave duration, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT duration should be stated on the ECG report. A comparative study is needed of global measurements made by different methods from a reference standard. Differences in global measurement algorithms and methods should be minimized to promote standardization, but these differences must be accounted for in comparative studies within individuals and between individuals. Attention must be paid to definition of normal ECG ranges in children and adolescents, as well as in adults, with stratification for specific age groups, sex, and race. Where methods vary, algorithm-specific normal ranges for intervals need to be derived. With respect to QT interval, the end of the T wave as determined globally should match with a well-defined T-wave offset in at least 1 of its component individual leads. Alternative methods of QT measurement from single or multiple leads may be prescribed for special purposes such as drug evaluation, but it is inappropriate for studies involving serial comparison of the QT interval to use differing methods of QT measurement within trials.\n---\n 1312 Circulation March 13, 2007\n\nData Compression for Transmission, Storage, and Retrieval of ECGs Technology\n\nDigitized at 500 samples per second, 10 seconds of a single lead of ECG record requires 10 kB of memory. Accordingly, 10 seconds of an uncompressed 12-lead ECG digitized at recommended standards would occupy about 80 to 100 Kb of memory, in addition to memory needed for template complexes and demographic data. Several methods of ECG data compression have been used to reduce processing time and to minimize the memory required for permanent data storage. Techniques include fast Fourier, discrete cosine, and wavelet transforms, as well as hybrid compression methods. These methods can provide compression ratios of 8:1 to 10:1 with resulting root mean square errors that range from <0.5% to 2%. Compression ratio is generally inversely related to root mean square error, so that a recent algorithm was able to provide a 20:1 compression ratio but with a root mean square error of 4%. Because compression affects high-frequency components of the ECG to a greater extent than low-frequency components, at least 1 algorithm has used bimodal decimation of the signal in which QRS complexes are kept at 500 samples per second while the rest of the recording is compressed to lower sampling rates. Compression of data may occur before or after signal processing, but in either case, compression occurs before transfer of the signal to central storage systems and affects all retrieved records. Accordingly, the 1990 AHA report recommended that the fidelity of retrieved compressed data should be within 10 V for corresponding samples. As computer networks increase transmission speed and storage capacity, lossless compression techniques may supersede other compression methods for some applications.\n\nRecommendation\n\nCompression algorithms should perform in a manner that allows retrieved data to adhere to the fidelity standards established in the 1990 AHA statement with reference to the original signal.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3355, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81b38b00-c0c5-4e31-902f-996efc3632c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "81b38b00-c0c5-4e31-902f-996efc3632c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed9058a2-5008-4b21-9070-0507ada1c7fb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "de36ba1ac85299643cfebe5a836adb4da9485531ba46fd1c1f56ebd2496ea902", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_ed9058a2-5008-4b21-9070-0507ada1c7fb_26_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'Technology': {0: 'The standard 12-lead ECG consists of 3 limb leads (leads I, II, and III), 3 augmented limb leads in which the Goldberger modification of the central terminal of Wilson serves as a derived indifferent electrode that is paired with the exploring electrode (leads aVR, aVL, and aVF), and 6 precordial leads in which the Wilson central terminal serves as a derived indifferent electrode that is paired with the exploring electrode (V 1 through V 6).

The opposite waveforms, by definition, are mirror images of the standard limb leads. In this sense, the electrical activity defined by a lead pair can be examined from either perspective. Distinction of single electrodes from established \u201cpoles\u201d is highlighted by selection of the LA electrode as the positive end of the LA-RA pair for lead I but not as the positive end of the LL-LA pair for lead III. Einthoven\u2019s law indicates that any 1 of the standard limb leads can be mathematically derived from the other 2 leads. As a consequence, the 3 standard limb leads contain only 2 independent pieces of information. Even though limb lead placement is often represented in terms of the apices of an equilateral triangle, known as the Einthoven triangle, Einthoven\u2019s law is entirely independent of any assumptions about geometric placement of the 3 electrodes. These considerations notwithstanding, redundant leads promote the appreciation of spatial morphological characteristics of the ECG and aid in its interpretation, such as calculation of axis, and consideration of the information from the perspective of both ends of the available leads can be clinically useful, particularly in the evaluation of ST-segment shifts during acute myocardial infarction.\n\nRecommendation\n\nUsers should recognize the redundancy of information in the standard limb leads.

Although redundancy exists within the 6 frontal plane leads, visualization of multiple leads promotes appreciation of spatial aspects of the ECG that can be important to clinical interpretation. Unlike the mathematical relationships between the frontal plane limb leads, each of the precordial electrodes provides uniquely measured potential differences at the recording site with reference to the central terminal. Because the exploring precordial electrodes are not connected in a closed electrical loop like the extremity electrodes, the precordial leads are independent of each other; none can be calculated precisely from other information in the ECG. Therefore, the \u201cstandard\u201d 12-lead ECG actually contains 8 independent pieces of information: 2 measured potential differences from which the 4 remaining limb leads can be calculated and the 6 independent precordial leads.\n---\nKligfield et al Standardization and Interpretation of the ECG, Part I 1315\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe augmented limb leads of the frontal plane and the precordial leads result from derived electrode pairs and should not be described as \u201cunipolar.\u201d Users should recognize the derived and redundant nature of the 3 augmented limb leads, but these are retained because multiple leads facilitate the clinical interpretation of the ECG.\n\nSimultaneous Lead Presentation Technology\n\nWith analog single-channel ECG recorders, each lead is recorded sequentially by means of a switching mechanism that connects applied electrodes in the prescribed combinations. Digital electrocardiographs are able to record the 8 channels of independent information simultaneously, with 4 of the limb leads being derived from the other 2. Alignment of separate channel writers must be precise to within 10 ms, and ideally less. The most commonly used output format involves lead separation based on rows and columns. For standard-sized paper, at 25 mm/s recording speed, four 2.5-second columns can be presented sequentially on the page, with no time disruption between different columns. Each column therefore represents successive 2.5-second intervals of a continuous 10-second record. In the most traditional simultaneous lead format, the first column records rows representing simultaneous leads I, II, and III; the second column records rows representing simultaneous aVR, aVL, and aVF; the third column represents simultaneous leads V1, V2, and V3; the fourth column represents simultaneous leads V4, V5, and V6. Additional rows may be available for 1, 2, or 3 leads of 10-second continuous recordings for rhythm analysis. Alternatively, additional rows may be utilized to present two 5-second recordings of 6 simultaneous limb leads and 6 simultaneous precordial leads, or 12 rows of simultaneous leads.\n\nClinical Implications\n\nThe major advantage of simultaneous lead acquisition is that it allows precise temporal alignment of waveforms from different leads, which results in spatial-temporal insights that have diagnostic value. By way of example, the temporal alignment of waveforms in aVR and aVL can aid in the diagnosis of fascicular block in the presence of infarction, whereas simultaneous views of P-wave and QRS waveforms in multiple leads can add information of value in the interpretation of arrhythmias and in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.\n\nRecommendation\n\nStandard tracings obtained with digital electrocardiographs should provide accurate temporal alignment of multiple leads, with maximum misalignment of no more than 10 ms, and ideally as little as is practically feasible. The printed tracing may present temporally aligned groups of leads in different formats according to preference.\n\nAlternative Information Format From Standard Leads Technology\n\nThe Cabrera or orderly sequence reorients the frontal plane leads into a progressive anatomic array that extends logically and sequentially in the same way that the precordial leads progress sequentially from V1 through V6.", "start_char_idx": 41270, "end_char_idx": 46340, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a570bbf-45f1-4b8f-8d08-792bd7264fdf": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a570bbf-45f1-4b8f-8d08-792bd7264fdf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed9058a2-5008-4b21-9070-0507ada1c7fb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "de36ba1ac85299643cfebe5a836adb4da9485531ba46fd1c1f56ebd2496ea902", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "89bffd0e-7e6f-4759-83d3-8e071f7e2861", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "9eba4098b1e7a18318634dc9dc25299539ce92eae2f6ffa27ead44b2b0454bf3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e2645c1-438f-4e22-b204-510f4686128a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "ff6fdda8d74864b3796582e10000ba6a6198d446ac90734894bdb89e01571315", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "By way of example, the temporal alignment of waveforms in aVR and aVL can aid in the diagnosis of fascicular block in the presence of infarction, whereas simultaneous views of P-wave and QRS waveforms in multiple leads can add information of value in the interpretation of arrhythmias and in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.\n\nRecommendation\n\nStandard tracings obtained with digital electrocardiographs should provide accurate temporal alignment of multiple leads, with maximum misalignment of no more than 10 ms, and ideally as little as is practically feasible. The printed tracing may present temporally aligned groups of leads in different formats according to preference.\n\nAlternative Information Format From Standard Leads Technology\n\nThe Cabrera or orderly sequence reorients the frontal plane leads into a progressive anatomic array that extends logically and sequentially in the same way that the precordial leads progress sequentially from V1 through V6. With inverted aVR (aVR or maVR) used to represent the signal between leads II and I, the sequence becomes, from right to left, III, aVF, II, aVR, I, and aVL, or from left to right, aVL, I, aVR, II, aVF, and III. In addition to improved spatial quantification of acute infarction, the Cabrera sequence facilitates calculation of the frontal plane axis. This presentation, when in sequence with the precordial leads, has also been termed the panoramic display.\n\nClinical Implications\n\nWhether presented serially from single-channel recorders or in standard array from simultaneous-lead\u2013acquisition devices, the sequence of limb lead presentation on ECG recordings is historical, not anatomic. Thus, whereas V1 through V6 progress leftward and slightly inferiorly across the precordium, the frontal plane limb leads follow no regular order that allows individual leads to be compared easily with anatomically directly adjacent leads. For example, lead aVF represents the potential difference from a vector perspective that is between lead III and lead II, but this is not easily appreciated from the standard array. Similarly, leads I and aVL are progressively counterclockwise, in the anatomic sense, from lead II. Lead aVR is often thought of as an intracavitary lead that looks toward the atria from the apex of the ventricles, but inversion of aVR can be considered to represent a perspective that lies anatomically within the counterclockwise progression from lead II to lead I. Use of inverted aVR has been reported to improve the diagnostic classification and estimation of risk associated with acute inferior and lateral myocardial infarction.\n\nRecommendations\n\nRoutine use of the Cabrera sequence for display of the limb leads can be highly recommended as an alternative presentation standard. For display in a format of 4 columns of 3 leads, a left-to-right sequence (aVL to III) is logical because it is closer to traditional placement of limb lead I at the upper left. To maintain consistency, the left-to-right sequence is also recommended for horizontal display of the limb leads. However, it is recognized that the current limb lead array is so deeply entrenched in ECG tradition that change might take years to become generally accepted. At present, manufacturers should be encouraged to make this display available as a routine option in new electrocardiographs.\n\nAlternative Lead Applications\n\nTorso and Other Modified Placement of the Limb Leads Technology\n\nNoise from motion of the arms and legs during ambulatory and exercise electrocardiography can be reduced by placement of the limb leads on the torso. In these diagnostic applications, 12-lead ECGs have been recorded with the Mason-Likar lead position, in which the arm electrodes are placed in the infraclavicular fossae medial to the deltoid insertions and the left leg electrode is placed midway between the costal margin and iliac crest in the left anterior axillary\n\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on December 12, 2023V, V, and V.

In addition, electrode H is placed at the junction of the neck and torso posteriorly, and electrode F is placed on the left foot. Orthogonal lead information is constructed from modeled weighting of lead voltages. The EASI lead system is a reduced 5-lead set that uses the E, A, and I electrodes from the Frank lead system and adds an electrode, S, at the top of the mid sternum, along with a ground reference electrode to provide orthogonally oriented signals. 113 In addition to orthogonal data, transfer coefficients have been developed for the EASI lead system that produce synthesized 12-lead ECGs. 114 Advantages of the EASI lead system for patient monitoring applications are the absence of limb electrodes, which allows the patient to move around without intolerable noise in the ECG signal, elimination of the need to determine intercostal spaces, and avoidance of the breast.\n\n Clinical Implications\n\nNoise from motion of the limbs during routine ambulation and during exercise makes standard limb lead electrode placement impractical for ECG monitoring. Typical monitoring applications include bedside hard-wired or telemetered observation of rhythm and ST segments, quantitative ambulatory electrocardiography, and ECG recording during diagnostic exercise testing. 108 Rhythm diagnosis is not adversely affected by monitoring lead placement; however, tracings that use torso electrodes differ in important ways from the standard 12-lead ECG. In addition to body position differences that affect the ECG, 109 monitoring electrodes placed on the trunk do not provide standard limb leads, and distortion of the central terminal alters the augmented limb leads and the precordial leads. 110,111 Tracings with Mason-Likar and other alternative lead placement may affect QRS morphology more than repolarization compared with the standard ECG; these differences can include false-negative and false-positive infarction criteria. 81,112 Motion artifact of the limbs is a particular problem for routine recording in neonates, infants, and young children, in whom torso leads are sometimes used; the clinical significance of the resulting differences remains to be established.\n\n Recommendations\n\nECGs recorded with torso placement of the extremity electrodes cannot be considered equivalent to standard ECGs for all purposes and should not be used interchangeably with standard ECGs for serial comparison. Evaluation of the effect of torso placement of limb leads on waveform amplitudes and durations in infants is required. Tracings that use torso limb lead placement must be clearly labeled as such, including 12-lead tracings derived from torso limb lead placement in neonates or in young children and during ambulatory and exercise electrocardiography in adults. Furthermore, tracings recorded in the sitting or upright position should not be considered equivalent to standard supine ECGs.\n\n Reduced Lead Sets\n\nTechnology It is possible to mathematically construct a synthesized 12-lead ECG from reduced lead sets. These syntheses can approximate but not duplicate the tracing obtained by the standard leads. The Frank lead system was devised as a lead set suitable for obtaining reproducible orthogonal lead information that could be used for vectorcardiography. 5 The system involves 7 electrodes, 5 of which are applied at points in the horizontal plane that intersect the fifth intercostal space at the left sternal border: A at the left midaxillary line, C on the anterior left chest wall halfway between E and A, E at the\n---\nKligfield et al Standardization and Interpretation of the ECG, Part I 1317\n\nstandard 12-lead recordings or recommended at present as an guidelines that requires \u201cST elevation\u201d in an intervention algorithm. Even so, ST elevation in posterior leads in acute posterior infarction is often &lt;1 mm in amplitude, and because of lead orientation, proximity effect, and torso inhomogeneity, it may not be equivalent in absolute magnitude to the ST depression present in anterior leads. ST elevation in 1 or more of the posterior leads has moderate sensitivity and high specificity for posterior wall infarction, 130 but the value of these additional findings for the prediction of increased in-hospital complications is unresolved. 126,131\n\nExpanded Lead Sets Technology Hybrid lead systems, incorporating 3 Frank leads with the standard 12 leads, can be used by some electrocardiographs.

ST elevation in 1 or more of the posterior leads has moderate sensitivity and high specificity for posterior wall infarction, 130 but the value of these additional findings for the prediction of increased in-hospital complications is unresolved. 126,131\n\nExpanded Lead Sets Technology Hybrid lead systems, incorporating 3 Frank leads with the standard 12 leads, can be used by some electrocardiographs. Expanded lead sets include the multiple-electrode arrays used for body surface mapping of the electrical activity of the heart. Torso arrays include wraparound electrodes in multiple horizontal and vertical lines. Details of these arrays are beyond the scope of the present report. Studies of body surface maps recorded from large electrode arrays have provided useful information about localization of ECG information on the thorax, but their complexity precludes their use as a substitute for the standard 12-lead ECG for routine recording purposes. Additional chest leads may be useful for investigation of acute infarction. Four additional precordial leads have been identified for use in this clinical setting (V 3R, V R, V R, and V R), each of which is placed on the right side in mirror image to the standard precordial placement of electrodes. Within this right-sided array of electrodes, standard V can be considered equivalent to V R, and standard V can be considered equivalent to V R. Examination of additional posterior chest leads has been proposed for the identification of ST-elevation events in the posterior wall, including V 7 (at the posterior axillary line), V 8(below the scapula), and V 9 (at the paravertebral border), each in the same horizontal plane as V 6.\n\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on December 12, 2023118 \u2013120\n\nClinical Implications Although acute right ventricular infarction can sometimes be recognized from ST-segment elevation in V , studies dating 1 from the early 1980s have demonstrated that additional right-sided precordial leads have value for the diagnosis of acute right ventricular infarction in patients with inferior infarction. 121\u2013123 In this setting, ST-segment elevation exceeding 0.1 mV in 1 or more of the right precordial leads is moderately sensitive and specific for right ventricular injury and has been associated with underlying right ventricular dysfunction 124,125 and greater in-hospital complications. 126 Acute infarction of the posterior wall of the left ventricle theoretically can be diagnosed from reciprocal ST-segment depression evident in precordial leads V 1 through V 3, and it appears that both the additional right-sided and additional posterior leads can be reconstructed from the standard ECG leads. 127 (Alternate description of this territory as anatomically inferolateral rather than posterior will be discussed elsewhere.) Additional leads have not provided increased sensitivity for infarction in all studies 128; however, ST-segment elevation over the posterior left chest has been reported to be the only site of ST elevation found in some cases of posterior infarction. 118 Recent guidelines for intervention in acute coronary syndromes differ in important ways for ST-elevation and for non\u2013ST-elevation infarction. 129 In this sense, anterior ST depression during infarction from a spatial vector perspective may be electrocardiographically equivalent to posterior ST elevation, but it may be quite different in terms of a literal interpretation of treatment.\n\nLead Switches and Misplacements Limb Lead and Precordial Lead Switches Technology Lead switches (or more correctly, electrode cable switches) occur when a dedicated lead wire and electrode combination is misplaced or when there is erroneous attachment of a dedicated lead wire to individually placed electrodes.

Limb lead switches can result in false-positive and false-negative signs of ischemia. 138 Some of these changes can be recognized by an alert technician or correctly interpreted by the reviewing physician, particularly when previous ECGs are available, whereas others may go unrecognized or require repeat recording of the ECG. 139 Transposition of the left and\n---\n 1318 Circulation March 13, 2007\n\nRight arm lead wires produces inversion of limb lead I, with a switch of leads II and III and a switch of leads aVR and aVL, whereas aVF remains unaltered. Because the central terminal is unaffected, there are no changes in the precordial leads. In normal situations, lead I is generally similar to V 6 with respect to the morphology of the P wave and QRS direction.\n\nA clue to distinction of these findings from those present in a patient with mirror-image dextrocardia is that lead misplacement results in an important discordance between lead I and V. As a corollary, the ECG in a patient with mirror-image dextrocardia may be \u201cnormalized\u201d by purposely reversing the left and right arm lead wires and using mirror-image right-sided precordial leads. Transposition of the right arm and right leg lead wires is also easy to recognize, because lead II now records the nearly zero potential difference that exists between the 2 legs, which results in very low amplitude only in lead II, with inverted symmetry between standard lead I and lead III. Transposition of the left arm and left leg lead wires is more difficult to recognize because the main effects are an often subtle shift in axis and inversion of lead III; it can be suspected from changes in P-wave morphology in the limb leads, although the specificity of this approach has been challenged. Suspected lead switches may be confirmed by reference to a prior or subsequent tracing with correct lead placement.\n\nTransposition of lead wires to V 1 and V 2, to V 2 and V 3, or within all 3 leads can cause a reversal of R-wave progression that simulates anteroseptal wall infarction, but this artifact often can be recognized by distorted progression of the precordial P waves and T waves in the same leads.\n\n Recommendations\n\nMedical personnel responsible for the recording of routine ECGs should receive training on the avoidance of lead switches and guidelines for their recognition. Lead-switch detection algorithms should be incorporated into digital electrocardiographs along with alarms for abnormally high lead impedance, and suspected misplacements should be identified to the person recording the ECG in time to correct the problem. If not corrected before recording, a diagnostic statement alerting the reader to the presence of different types of lead switches should be incorporated into preliminary interpretive reports.\n\n Lead Misplacement Technology\n\nECG amplitudes and duration measurements vary with precordial lead placement, which often ranges widely from the recommended anatomic sites. The early work of Kerwin et al demonstrated that reproducibility of precordial lead placement to within 1 cm occurred only in about half of men and in even fewer women. Placement accuracy during routine electrocardiography appears to have decreased further with time. A recent study documented that fewer than two thirds of routinely applied precordial electrodes were applied within 1.25 inch of the designated landmark, but errors were not distributed randomly. A more vertical distribution of precordial electrodes than required resulted from superior misplacement of V 1 and V 2 electrodes in more than half of cases.\n---\n Kligfield et al Standardization and Interpretation of the ECG, Part I\n\nDepending on a database of well-documented cases to find the optimal ECG parameters to use.

Such a database must be large enough that the results are statistically reliable. The database must contain sufficient cases with varying degrees of abnormality, ranging from mild to severe cases, and a representative distribution of common confounding conditions. The statistics of well-documented populations have been used to develop diagnostic algorithms that no longer simply mimic the human reader. Similarly, it has also been shown that the addition of vector loop criteria (or the equivalent information deduced from simultaneous leads) improves 12-lead ECG diagnoses.\n\n Clinical Implications\n\nGiven the potentially profound effects of technical factors on ECG measurements, it is not surprising that identical diagnostic algorithms might perform differently when applied to ECG signals that undergo processing by different methods. Adherence to methodological standards will minimize these differences, promote uniformity of measurement and interpretation, and facilitate serial comparison of tracings. Even with adherence to standards, small systematic differences in measurements might be expected between diagnostic instruments that use different processing methods, particularly with respect to diagnostically important global measures of QRS duration and QT interval. A 1985 study by the European CSE group demonstrated that measurement differences among 10 standard ECG systems could be large enough to alter diagnostic conclusions; however, no recent studies have directly compared template and global measurements made with the current generation of commercially available standard ECG recording systems.\n\nBeyond the technical issues of measurement fidelity, evaluation of the performance of ECG programs is difficult. Programs may be compared with diagnoses of an expert cardiologist or consensus of expert cardiologists or with diagnoses ascertained by independent data. The CSE group evaluated 15 ECG and vectorcardiographic analysis programs against a reference database that included documented cases of ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial infarction, diagnoses that are strongly dependent on accurate measurement of amplitudes and durations and should favor computer analysis. Overall, the percentage of ECGs correctly classified by the computer programs was lower than that for the cardiologists, whereas important differences in overall accuracy were found between different algorithms.\n\n Recommendations\n\nComputer-based interpretation of the ECG is an adjunct to the electrocardiographer, and all computer-based reports require physician overreading. Accurate individual templates should be formed in each lead before final feature extraction and measurement used for diagnostic interpretation. Time-coherent data from multiple leads should be used to detect the earliest onset and latest offset of waveforms of global measurements used for diagnostic interpretation. Deterministic and statistical or probabilistic algorithms should be based on well-constructed databases that include varying degrees of pathology and an appropriate distribution of confounding conditions. Such algorithms should be validated with data that have not been used for development. Programs using complex diagnostic algorithms should document in reference material those measurements that are critical to the diagnostic statement, which might include synthesized vector loop or other novel measurements. Serial comparisons of sequential ECGs should be done by trained observers regardless of whether the ECG program provides a serial comparison. Assessment of the performance of different algorithms will be facilitated by use of a standardized glossary of interpretive statements.\n\n Summary\n\nThe present document outlines the relation of the modern digital electrocardiograph to its technology. Individual features of ECG processing and recording are considered in terms of their clinical implications. Recommendations focus on progress toward optimal use of the ECG. It is hoped that the standards set out in this document will provide a further stimulus to the improvement of ECG recording and interpretation.\n---", "start_char_idx": 24201, "end_char_idx": 28945, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49d162b1-c85e-4109-94c2-1b6e4604574c": {"__data__": {"id_": "49d162b1-c85e-4109-94c2-1b6e4604574c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed9058a2-5008-4b21-9070-0507ada1c7fb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part I.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 176443, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "de36ba1ac85299643cfebe5a836adb4da9485531ba46fd1c1f56ebd2496ea902", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_ed9058a2-5008-4b21-9070-0507ada1c7fb_52_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'Writing Group Member': {0: 'Paul Kligfield', 1: 'James J.

This effort was motivated by the existence of multiple automated diagnostic code sets containing imprecise and overlapping terms. An intended outcome of this statement list is greater uniformity of ECG diagnosis and a resultant improvement in patient care. The lexicon includes primary diagnostic statements, secondary diagnostic statements, modifiers, and statements for the comparison of ECGs. This diagnostic lexicon should be reviewed and updated periodically. (Circulation. 2007;115:1325-1332.)

Some statements that are commonly used by electrocardiographers but that do not provide diagnostically or clinically useful information are not included. Some statements have been excluded to reduce the size of the statement set, so long as their meaning is well represented by included terms. The Writing Group believes that the listing should be implemented as an available lexicon in report algorithms of the existing commercial electrocardiographs and that it should be used widely by ECG readers. The principal advantage of such use would be a worldwide improvement in uniformity of ECG interpretation. Such uniformity would promote better patient\n\nOther members of the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram Writing Group include James J.

Additional advantages would be facilitation of the establishment of a uniform teaching curriculum in electrocardiography, availability of a uniform glossary of terms for research application, and promotion of research to better validate diagnostic criteria for the specific terms in the limited lexicon. Although we recognize that each vendor of ECGs possesses a proprietary set of diagnostic statements and underlying criteria, we hope that this list of statements will be made available by each of them so that the reader can select it as the primary dictionary for use in interpreting all or some ECGs. We are also hopeful that the vendors will collaborate among themselves to align diagnostic criteria for this specific lexicon. This would not interfere with continued development of entirely independent, proprietary diagnostic software by each manufacturer.\n\nOrganization and Use\n\nFour lists are included within this document. The main listing (Table 1), \u201cPrimary Statements,\u201d displays 117 primary diagnostic statements under 14 categories. The majority of the primary statements are nondescriptive and convey clinical meaning without additional statements. The second listing (Table 2), \u201cSecondary Statements,\u201d provides additional statements that can be used to expand the specificity and clinical relevance of both descriptive and other primary diagnostic statements. These secondary statements are divided into 2 groups. Those that are preceded by \u201csuggests\u201d invoke clinical diagnoses likely responsible for the ECG observation(s). Those that are preceded by \u201cconsider\u201d are intended to propose at least 1, but sometimes potentially associated clinical disorder. This set of primary and secondary diagnostic statements constitutes what we might call the \u201ccore statement lexicon.\u201d\n\nThe third list (Table 3) contains adjectives that can be used to modify the diagnostic statements. None of the modifiers change the meaning of the core statement but rather serve to refine the meaning. The list contains general modifiers, which can be used with many of the core statements, and specific modifiers assigned to a specific category of statements.\n\nThe fourth list (Table 4) is a short directory of comparison statements. It specifies 6 types of ECG changes that merit mention in the ECG interpretation and defines criteria to identify change within the 6 categories.

Global intervals, from the earliest onset to the latest offset of the waveform in all leads (generally taken from a spatial vector magnitude or superimposed complexes), are the desirable standard. Global intervals, by definition, will be longer than measurements from single leads. QRS duration may increase with increasing heart size. In addition, the QRS complex is wider in the precordial than in the limb leads. There are also age- and gender-dependent differences in children and adolescents. In children less than 4 years of age, a QRS duration of 90 ms or more is considered to be prolonged, and in those whose ages are 4 to 16 years, a QRS duration of 100 ms or more is considered to be prolonged. In adult males, the QRS duration may be up to 110 ms. In normal males more than 18 years of age, QRS duration ranged from 74 to 114 ms, with an average of 95 ms. Because global data and data detailing the effects of age, gender, and race are still evolving, the committee recommends that for the present, a QRS duration of greater than 110 ms in subjects older than 16 years of age be regarded as abnormal. The data for both children and adults may have to be revised in the near future.\n\n Complete RBBB\n\n1. QRS duration greater than or equal to 120 ms in adults, greater than 100 ms in children ages 4 to 16 years, and greater than 90 ms in children less than 4 years of age. 2. rsr\u25af, rsR\u25af, or rSR\u25af in leads V 1 or V 2. The R\u25af or r\u25af deflection is usually wider than the initial R wave.

When a pure dominant R wave wip or wipout a notch is present in V1, criterion 4 should be satisfied.\nIncomplete RBBB\nIncomplete RBBB is defined by QRS duration between 110 and 120 ms in adults, between 90 and 100 ms in children between 4 and 16 years of age, and between 86 and 90 ms in children less pan 8 years of age. Oper criteria are pe same as for complete RBBB. In children, incomplete RBBB may be diagnosed when pe terminal rightward deflection is less pan 40 ms but greater pan or equal to 20 ms. The ECG pattern of incomplete RBBB may be present in pe absence of heart disease, particularly when pe V1 lead is recorded higher pan or to pe right of normal position and r\u25af is less pan 20 ms.\nThe terms rsr\u25af and normal rsr\u25af are not recommended to describe such patterns, because peir meaning can be variably interpreted. In children, an rsr\u25af pattern in V1 and V2 wip a normal QRS duration is a normal variant.\nComplete LBBB\nQRS duration greater pan or equal to 120 ms in adults, greater pan 100 ms in children 4 to 16 years of age, and greater pan 90 ms in children less pan 4 years of age.\nBroad notched or slurred R wave in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 and an occasional RS pattern in V5 and V6 attributed to displaced transition of QRS complex.\nAbsent q waves in leads I, V5, and V6, but in pe lead aVL, a narrow q wave may be present in pe absence of myocardial papology.\nR peak time greater pan 60 ms in leads V5 and V6 but normal in leads V1, V2, and V3, when small initial r waves can be discerned in pe above leads.\nST and T waves usually opposite in direction to QRS.\nPositive T wave in leads wip upright QRS may be normal (positive concordance).\nDepressed ST segment and/or negative T wave in leads wip negative QRS (negative concordance) are abnormal and are discussed in part VI of pis statement.", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 3803, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f43d055d-abe2-4f0e-869c-be9f01c91966": {"__data__": {"id_": "f43d055d-abe2-4f0e-869c-be9f01c91966", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram -

Rautaharju, MD, PhD; Borys Surawicz, MD, FAHA, FACC; Leonard S. Gettes, MD, FAHA, FACC\n\nThe present article is the fourth in a series of 6 documents focused on providing current guidelines for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG). The project was initiated by the Council on Clinical Cardiology of the American Heart Association. The rationale for this project and the process for its implementation were described earlier.\n\nAbnormalities in the ST segment, T wave, and duration of the QT interval reflect abnormalities in ventricular repolarization. These abnormalities are common and often difficult to interpret. The U wave most likely represents an electric-mechanical phenomenon that occurs after repolarization is completed. However, it is frequently included in discussions of repolarization and is discussed in this section.\n\nThe ST segment corresponds to the plateau phase of the ventricular transmembrane action potential. Under normal conditions, the transmembrane voltage changes slowly during this phase and remains at approximately the same level in all ventricular myocardial cells. As a result, only small voltage gradients are present. This absence of pronounced voltage gradients is similar to that which occurs during electric diastole, ie, from the end of repolarization to the onset of the next depolarization, when ventricular myocardial cells are at their resting transmembrane potential of approximately -85 mV. This corresponds to the TP segment on the ECG. The absence of significant voltage gradients in ventricular myocardial cells during these 2 phases of the cardiac cycle explains why the ST and TP segments are normally nearly flat and at approximately the same level; that is, they are isoelectric.\n\nThe T wave corresponds to the phase of rapid ventricular repolarization (phase 3) of the ventricular action potential.\n\nOther members of the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram Writing Group include James J. Bailey, MD; Rory Childers, MD; Barbara J. Deal, MD, FACC; Anton Gorgels, MD; E. William Hancock, MD, FACC; Mark Josephson, MD, FACC, FHRS; Paul Kligfield, MD, FAHA, FACC; Jan A.

Wagner, MD; and Hein Wellens, MD, FAHA, FACC.\n\nThe American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Heart Rhythm Society make every effort to avoid any actual or potential conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of an outside relationship or a personal, professional, or business interest of a member of the writing panel. Specifically, all members of the writing group are required to complete and submit a Disclosure Questionnaire showing all such relationships that might be perceived as real or potential conflicts of interest.\n\nParts I and II of this series, \"Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram,\" were published in the March 13, 2007, issue of Circulation (Circulation. 2007;115:1306\u20131324 and 1325\u20131332).

They include the distinction between primary and secondary repolarization abnormalities, appropriate descriptive and interpretive terminology, and measurement of the QT interval and its adjustment for rate, gender, and QRS duration.\n\nDistinction Between Primary and Secondary Repolarization Abnormalities\n\nAbnormalities in the ST segment and T wave, which are the result of changes in the shape and/or duration of the repolar- ization phases of the transmembrane action potential and occur in the absence of changes in depolarization, are referred to as primary repolarization abnormalities. They may be localized or diffuse and may be caused by a variety of events, including ischemia, myocarditis, drugs, toxins, and electro- lyte abnormalities, particularly abnormalities of serum cal- cium and potassium. An abrupt change in heart rate, hyper- ventilation, changes in body position, catecholamines, sympathetic stimulation or ablation of the stellate ganglion, and temperature changes also can cause primary repolariza- tion abnormalities. 8,9\n\nAbnormalities in the ST segment and T wave that occur as the direct result of changes in the sequence and/or duration of ventricular depolarization, manifested electrocardiographi- cally as changes in QRS shape and/or duration, are referred to as secondary repolarization abnormalities.

However, some secondary repolarization changes take longer (hours or days) to develop and to dissipate. The repolarization changes associated with prolonged ventricular pacing are examples of this phenomenon. 12\n\nPrimary and secondary repolarization abnormalities may occur concurrently. For example, ventricular hypertrophy is associated with changes in the shape and duration of the ventricular action potential of isolated ventricular cells, par- ticularly on the endocardial surface. 13 These changes may contribute to ST- and T-wave changes and are independent of the changes that are secondary to QRS-amplitude changes and prolongation of the QRS complex. A combination of primary and secondary repolarization abnormalities should also be considered when T-wave polarity does not change as anticipated by the changes in the QRS complex.\n\nRecommendation\n\nThe distinction between primary and secondary repolariza- tion abnormalities is clinically relevant because primary abnormalities indicate changes in the repolarization charac-\n---\nRautaharju et al Standardization and Interpretation of the ECG, Part IV e243\n\nST-Segment Abnormalities\n\nST- and T-wave amplitudes are referenced against the TP or PR segments of the ECG. When low-frequency filtering is done in ECG acquisition to remove baseline drift, the actual DC voltage levels of various ECG waves or segments cannot be determined. Thus, elevation of the ST segment may reflect PR/TP depression, true ST elevation, or both; conversely, ST depression may reflect PR/TP elevation, true ST depression, or both. 14 \u201316When considering deviations of the ST segment, one should bear in mind total QRS amplitude because this variable also affects the amplitude of ST-segment abnormalities. Displacement of the ST segment is usually measured at its junction with the end of the QRS complex, the \u201cJ point,\u201d and, in some settings such as exercise testing, 40 and up to 80 ms after the J point. The ST segment can be described as elevated, depressed, upsloping, horizontal, or downsloping. In addition, the magnitude of abnormal deviations and the leads showing them should be identified. A depressed ST segment may be further characterized as horizontal, downsloping, or upsloping (rapidly or slowly).\n\nElevation of the ST segment in leads V 1, V2, and V 3 should be referenced against the elevation that occurs normally in these leads and is greater in young and middle-aged males than in females 17\u201321 and greater in blacks than in whites. 21 ST elevation is usually most pronounced in chest lead V 2. The upper normal limit for J-point elevation in V 2 varies to a certain degree in various reference sources, probably largely as a result of differing selection criteria for the normal group. One reference source 20 reports the upper 98th percentile normal limit as approximately 0.3 mV in white men less than 40 years of age (up to 0.33 mV in the 24- to 29-year age group) and approximately 0.25 mV in white men 40 years old and older. The corresponding limits for white women remain relatively unchanged with age, staying at approximately 0.15 mV. 21\n\nAnother reference source lists normal limits for J-point and ST 60 (ST at 60 ms past the J point) amplitudes for white and black men and women 40 years old and older in 2 age groups.

For evaluation of ST elevation, reference values established in adequately large population-based groups stratified by age, gender, and race should be incorporated into computer-ECG ST-segment classification algorithms to avoid the inappropriate diagnosis of injury currents associated with myocardial ischemia/infarction or pericarditis.\n\nT-Wave Abnormalities Just as ST-segment segment abnormalities can occur with or without T-wave abnormalities, T-wave abnormalities can occur in the presence or absence of ST-segment segment abnormalities. The T-wave amplitude in limb leads is influenced by the frontal-plane T axis, which in turn is influenced by the QRS axis. In children older than 1 month, the T wave is often inverted in leads V 1, V 2, and V 3. In adolescents 12 years old and older and in young adults less than 20 years of age, the T wave may be slightly inverted in aVF and inverted in lead V 2. In adults 20 years old and older, the normal T wave is inverted in aVR; upright or inverted in leads aVL, III, and V 1; and upright in leads I and II and in chest leads V 3 through V 6.\n\nRecommendation The ECG report should include a description of T-wave abnormalities, identification of associated ST-segment changes if present, and a statement as to whether the changes are indeterminate or more likely to be associated with a specific cause.\n\nT-Wave Alternans T-wave alternans signifies T-wave amplitude variations that alternate every second beat. These amplitude variations are quantified with various modifications of moving-average analysis or as the variance of specific frequency components in spectral analysis. T-wave alternans is typically observed as microvolt-level variation (microvolt T-wave alternans) and, at times, as more pronounced variations in alternating complexes or as slower components outside the range of the proper T-wave alternans, generally most prominent in phase with respiration.\n\nThe U Wave The U wave is a mechanoelectric phenomenon that results in a low-amplitude, low-frequency deflection that occurs after the T wave.", "start_char_idx": 15042, "end_char_idx": 19361, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cf111cf-a94f-49b8-8cca-642027986ae8": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cf111cf-a94f-49b8-8cca-642027986ae8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 108224, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1622781e-3e18-47f1-8ca3-6115289a7691", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 108224, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "c0f8b454eb1cf09376d40d8fd71daa3d634921919931f4b60fe27ac3d859d15a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9feb27d7-ec18-45df-9526-df0814d17aa6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 108224, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "3b5f726098f8b108448a3498738240014480090c3d00623f61aa7d25c6859a1e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a6e32df-ba03-4781-9c27-5b46f2742d96", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 108224, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "e978e53e40e838e52d046b12222a1469aa0936f9074b8318f8ccc95e01d30659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Recommendation The ECG report should include a description of T-wave abnormalities, identification of associated ST-segment changes if present, and a statement as to whether the changes are indeterminate or more likely to be associated with a specific cause.\n\nT-Wave Alternans T-wave alternans signifies T-wave amplitude variations that alternate every second beat.

It is frequently absent in the limb leads and is\n---\n Rautaharju et al Standardization and Interpretation of the ECG, Part IV e245\n\nMost evident in leads V2 and V3, where its amplitude has been recognizing the onset of the QRS complex and the end of the T wave, determining the appropriate lead(s) in which to measure the QT interval, and adjusting the QT interval for increases in QRS duration, gender, and rate.\n\nWhen the majority of ECGs were recorded on single-channel analog machines, various leads were recorded sequentially, and the QT interval was measured manually in the individual leads. Determination of the end of the T wave was often difficult and sometimes impossible, and the onset of the QRS complex and the end of the T wave varied in different leads, appearing shorter when the axis of an individual lead was more perpendicular to the spatial vector of the onset of the QRS complex or the end of the T wave. The onset of the QRS complex tends to occur up to 20 ms earlier in V2 and V3 than in the limb leads. Some regard differences of up to 50 ms in QT intervals measured in the various leads in normal subjects as being normal; others have suggested that differences of up to 65 ms were still within the limit of normal. This value is reported to be less in women than in men.\n\nWhen the QT interval is measured in individual leads, the lead showing the longest QT should be used. This is usually V2 or V3. However, if this measurement differs by more than 40 ms from that in other leads, the measurement may be in error, and measurements from adjacent leads should be considered. If the T wave and U wave are superimposed or cannot be separated, it is recommended that the QT be measured in the leads not showing U waves, often aVR and aVL, or that the downslope of the T wave be extended by drawing a tangent to the steepest proportion of the downslope until it crosses the TP segment. It should be recognized that defining the end of the T wave in these ways might underestimate the QT interval.\n\nAs detailed in the section on ECG technology, most currently used automated digital machines record all leads simultaneously. This technique permits their temporal alignment and superimposition, which facilitates a more accurate assessment of the beginning of the QRS complex, the end of the T wave, and the separation of the U wave from the T wave. As a result, the automatically measured QT interval is often longer than the QT interval as measured in any individual lead, and the values currently regarded as normal, which were established with single-channel sequential recordings, may no longer be valid. Most automated systems do not routinely display the superimposed tracings or the points used to derive the QT interval.\n\nIn view of the clinical importance of the QT-interval prolongation, it is essential to visually validate QT-interval prolongation reported by a computer algorithm.\n\nRecommendation Statements concerning the U wave should be included in the ECG interpretation when the U wave is inverted, when it is merged with the T wave, or when its amplitude is greater than that of the T wave.\n\n The QT Interval\n\nMeasurement of the QT interval and its adjustment for rate, gender, and QRS prolongation represent 2 of the major challenges in electrocardiography.

In view of the clinical importance of QT-interval prolongation, it is essential to visually validate QT-interval prolongation reported by a computer algorithm.\n\nQT Correction for Rate\n\nMany formulas have been proposed to adjust the QT interval for rate. The most widely used is the formula derived by Bazett in 1920 from a graphic plot of measured QT intervals in 39 young subjects. This adjustment procedure divides the measured QT by the square root of the RR interval to derive the rate-adjusted value. The formula introduced by Fridericia, also in 1920, uses the cube root of RR. Bazett\u2019s formula leaves a strong positive residual correlation (r\u00020.32) and Fridericia\u2019s formula leaves a negative correlation (r\u0002\u00010.26 to \u00010.32) with heart rate, and the adjusted QT values may be substantially in error, particularly when the heart rate is high. More recently introduced formulas for QT adjustment as a linear or power function of RR or heart rate for adults and for children effectively remove the rate dependence of the adjusted QT, and they are clearly preferable to both Bazett\u2019s and Fridericia\u2019s formulas. Some investigators have introduced separate normal limits or rate correction factors for each heart rate subinterval using the so-called \u201cbin method.\u201d\n\nRecommendation\n\nIt is recommended that linear regression functions rather than the Bazett\u2019s formula be used for QT-rate correction and that the method used for rate correction be identified in ECG analysis reports. In addition, rate correction of the QT interval should not be attempted when RR interval variability is large, as often occurs with atrial fibrillation, or when identification of the end of the T wave is unreliable.\n\nQT Correction for Gender and the Limits for Prolonged and Short QT Interval\n\nAlthough Bazett\u2019s and Fridericia\u2019s formulas make no adjustment for gender, many studies have demonstrated that the QT interval is longer in young and middle-aged females than in males. The gender difference is potentially important because women are generally considered to be more prone to malignant arrhythmias in LQTS than men. The gender difference appears during adolescence, when the rate-adjusted QT shortens in boys, possibly as a testosterone effect, but undergoes little change in girls.", "start_char_idx": 22274, "end_char_idx": 26931, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53bf7223-2abb-49b4-91f1-ae9bba9763f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "53bf7223-2abb-49b4-91f1-ae9bba9763f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 108224, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1622781e-3e18-47f1-8ca3-6115289a7691", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 108224, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "c0f8b454eb1cf09376d40d8fd71daa3d634921919931f4b60fe27ac3d859d15a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a6e32df-ba03-4781-9c27-5b46f2742d96", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 108224, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "e978e53e40e838e52d046b12222a1469aa0936f9074b8318f8ccc95e01d30659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_1622781e-3e18-47f1-8ca3-6115289a7691_14_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "", "file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 108224, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "a50e434e234073d1b18ca1e76458cdd9ba209b0706eadf72e87fd3d7cf47c740", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In addition, rate correction of the QT interval should not be attempted when RR interval variability is large, as often occurs with atrial fibrillation, or when identification of the end of the T wave is unreliable.\n\nQT Correction for Gender and the Limits for Prolonged and Short QT Interval\n\nAlthough Bazett\u2019s and Fridericia\u2019s formulas make no adjustment for gender, many studies have demonstrated that the QT interval is longer in young and middle-aged females than in males.

Overall, the gender difference in rate-adjusted QT interval becomes small after 40 years of age and practically disappears in older men and women. Separate gender- and age-specific QT-adjustment formulas have been proposed to accommodate these differences.\n\nRecommendation\n\nQT- and JT-adjustment formulas have recently been introduced for use in the setting of prolonged ventricular conduction. With confirmation, they may be incorporated into automated algorithms to provide appropriate correction factors.\n\nEvaluation of QT Intervals in Sequential Tracings\n\nEvaluation of QT intervals from sequential ECG recordings is essential for identification of QT prolongation induced by\n---\n Rautaharju et al Standardization and Interpretation of the ECG, Part IV e247\n\nPharmacological agents in drug studies. It is also helpful as an adjunct to ST analysis in determining the presence of active ischemia in patients suspected of having myocardial infarction.\n\nWhen sequential tracings from patients recorded at different times of day and at different locations are compared, it is important to recognize that the time of day can influence the QT interval, that differences may exist between the different recording systems and between the programs used for QT measurement, and that different formulas for QT-rate adjustment may have been used. Moreover, there is a significant interreader variability in the measurement of QT interval. Rigorous standardization of the recording and evaluation procedures should be followed when serial comparison of QT intervals is undertaken.\n\nThe FDA guide for industry suggests that in the evaluation of possible QT prolongation induced by drugs, 2 levels of change in serial ECGs in the rate-corrected QT from the baseline be reported: an increase of greater than 30 ms and an increase of greater than 60 ms.\n\n Recommendation\n\nIt is recommended that for serial comparisons ECG recorders meet specific performance standards and, if possible, be of the same type; that uniform, carefully standardized ECG acquisition and QT-measurement procedures be used; and that, whenever possible, a single reader be responsible for overreading sequential tracings of an individual patient or research subject.\n\nQT Dispersion\n\nIncreased heterogeneity of myocardial repolarization may predispose patients to the development of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. As indicated above, significant differences exist in the duration of the QT interval when measured in the individual leads. Visualization of these differences is facilitated by the display of a suitable subset of temporally aligned simultaneous leads with a slight separation on the amplitude scale.\n\n Recommendation\n\nIt is recommended that QT dispersion not be included in routine ECG reports. However, because of the fundamental importance of the heterogeneity of myocardial repolarization in the genesis of malignant ventricular arrhythmias, continued research into the identification of markers of increased dispersion of myocardial repolarization on the body surface ECG is encouraged.\n---", "start_char_idx": 26140, "end_char_idx": 30137, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6189265b-4911-4345-8b2a-578a0c120c25": {"__data__": {"id_": "6189265b-4911-4345-8b2a-578a0c120c25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 108224, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1622781e-3e18-47f1-8ca3-6115289a7691", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part IV.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 108224, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "c0f8b454eb1cf09376d40d8fd71daa3d634921919931f4b60fe27ac3d859d15a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_1622781e-3e18-47f1-8ca3-6115289a7691_14_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'Writing Group Member': {0: 'James J.

Its importance has increased in recent years with the recognition that hypertrophy can be reversed with therapy, and that by doing so, adverse clinical outcomes can be prevented or delayed. 1,2\n\n(Note: This report uses the term hypertrophy rather than enlargement. The 1978 Bethesda Conference favored use of the term enlargement, but hypertrophy is more commonly used in recent research reports, although not necessarily in textbooks. Enlargement may be taken to imply an increase in chamber dimension, which may not be present in concentric hypertrophy. It is doubtful whether enlargement occurs without hypertrophy, at least in chronic stable syndromes. As discussed below, distinctive P-wave abnormalities may occur in the absence of atrial hypertrophy or dilation.)\n\nThe principal electrocardiogram (ECG) changes associated with ventricular hypertrophy are increases in QRS amplitude and duration, changes in instantaneous and mean QRS vectors, abnormalities in the ST segment and T waves, and abnormalities in the P wave. These changes have been correlated with direct or indirect assessments of ventricular size or mass to establish electrocardiographic criteria for the diagnosis of hypertrophy.\n\nOther members of the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram Writing Group include James J.

The ECG criteria for LVH shown in Table 1 have evolved over pe years. Criteria were originally based on R and S amplitudes in standard limb leads I and III, using clinical and autopsy data as reference standards. (Amplitudes of ECG complexes are referred to in millimeters, raper pan millivolts. Using normal standardization, 10 mm equals 1 mV; 1 mm equals 0.1 mV.) Many oper voltage criteria were introduced after pe general acceptance of pe standard 12-lead ECG, most notably by Sokolow and Lyon, who in 1949 introduced pe widely used criterion based on pe sum of S V1 and R V5 or R V6. More recently, pe sum of S V3 and R aVL, referred to as pe \"Cornell voltage,\" has been used. The point score of Romhilt and Estes, introduced in 1968, incorporates abnormalities in QRS axis and duration, QRS onset-to-peak time, and P and ST-T morphology, in addition to QRS amplitude. More recently, more complex criteria pat are easily implemented wip computerized recording and interpretation systems have been developed. These include indices based on products of voltage and QRS duration, computation of QRS area, composite use of several criteria, and indices based on scores derived from regression equations pat incorporate multiple electrocardiographic and nonelectrocardiographic factors.\n\nThe existence of many different criteria for diagnosing LVH makes clinical application more complex. The sensitivity of the various criteria is generally quite low (usually less than 50%), whereas the specificity is quite high (often in the range of 85% to 90%). However, the sensitivity and specificity of each criterion is different. Thus, the diagnostic accuracy will depend on the specific criterion used. Because of these differences in sensitivity and specificity, patients who meet one set of criteria for LVH commonly do not meet\n\nOriginally, measurement of ventricular mass at autopsy or other criteria.", "start_char_idx": 3485, "end_char_idx": 7914, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b0b8921-c64d-4735-8afd-8be37a67846f": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b0b8921-c64d-4735-8afd-8be37a67846f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 105000, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1efc066-1be5-4ae3-8239-d3c01b76dbfe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 105000, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "7f118ca6d24e02fdc0eb1c5012c875569b02e2a6e1c2cb10c9f1adb8a95424e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "24c0ee60-41a3-458e-b2c8-4baa6b87517e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 105000, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "2e0125602794de703d34477387becf4023543d7604f6b5e3b2985bfbf7fd7960", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_e1efc066-1be5-4ae3-8239-d3c01b76dbfe_6_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "", "file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 105000, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "1168942faff5569852a89a1f564ccf66b6d4ab3f1a1ed1dd63a06b8d9b5fe536", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "More recently, more complex criteria pat are easily implemented wip computerized recording and interpretation systems have been developed.

In a large group of patients with mild or the clinical features of the patients were the reference moderate hypertension, only 11.2% of patients with LVH by standards used to establish ECG criteria. Later, the ECG changes were referenced against findings from various imaging modalities such as chest radiography or left ventriculography. In recent years, 2-dimensional echocardiography has become the favored reference standard, but it is now being challenged by 3-dimensional echocardiography, computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Although these newer imaging techniques provide a more accurate assessment of ventricular myocardial mass than does the ECG, they do not obviate the clinical use of the ECG. The greater convenience and lower cost of the ECG continue to support its widespread use for the diagnosis of ventricular hypertrophy in clinical practice, epidemiological studies, and clinical trials. In addition, some ECG abnormalities have been shown to have independent clinical prognostic value.\n\nPublished studies are currently insufficient to indicate whether any of the more recently proposed criteria are clearly superior to the others or are simply redundant. The data do suggest that interpretations should specify which criteria are used in making a diagnosis and that automated systems should apply multiple criteria. Furthermore, because the accuracy of the criteria is empirical, that is, dependent on correlations between specific ECG measurements and a reference standard, only ECG criteria that have been formally tested should be used without modification from the tested form.\n\nOne important issue in developing and applying diagnostic criteria for LVH based on QRS voltage is that QRS voltages are influenced by a variety of factors other than left ventricular size or mass. These factors include age, gender, race, and body habitus. Their effects may contribute to the limited accuracy of the ECG criteria. Day-to-day variability and variability resulting from variations in the sites of electrode placement also impact QRS voltages and, hence, the diagnostic value of ECG voltage criteria.\n\nAge\n\nApart from the wide variation in the normal limits of QRS voltage in infants and children of various ages, there are important differences between adults of various ages, with QRS voltages tending to decline with increasing age. In general, the commonly used QRS voltage criteria apply to adults older than 35 years. Standards for the 16- to 35-year age group are not as well-established, and the diagnosis of LVH based on voltage alone has a low accuracy in this age group. The diagnosis of LVH in highly trained athletes is especially problematic.\n\nGender\n\nAdult women have a slightly lower upper limit of QRS voltage than men do, although S V3 is the only measurement with a large difference. The difference persists after adjustment for body size and cardiac mass. Some criteria have been shown to improve their performance with gender adjustment, but the adjustment is not the same for all criteria.\n\nRace\n\nNormal values of QRS voltages vary by race. African-Americans have a higher upper normal limit of QRS voltage than do Euro-Americans, whereas Hispanic Americans have lower limits. In patients with mild or moderate hypertension, the Sokolow-Lyon criterion has a higher sensitivity and lower specificity in African-Americans than in Euro-Americans, whereas the Cornell voltage criterion shows lower sensitivity and higher specificity in African-Americans than in Euro-Americans.\n\nBody Habitus\n\nObesity is associated with increased left ventricular mass by echocardiographic measurement but not with increased QRS voltage.

LAD indicates left axis deviation.\n\nThe Diagnostic Role of QRS Duration\n\nQRS duration is frequently increased in LVH. This is manifest by a diffuse increase in QRS duration or an increase in the time from onset of QRS to the R-wave peak in V5 or V6. The increased QRS duration may be attributed to the increased thickness of the left ventricle wall and to intramural fibrosis, which distorts and prolongs transmural impulse propagation.\n---\n e254 Circulation March 17, 2009\n\nWhen the electrocardiographic pattern of LVH with widened QRS is present, there may be loss of the septal Q wave, often with a slurred R-wave upstroke. In these cases, it is reasonable to diagnose associated incomplete left bundle-branch block, an entity that is commonly seen only in the presence of LVH. A progression from LVH alone to incomplete left bundle-branch block may be observed.\n\nST-T Abnormalities With LVH\n\nThe association of inverted T waves with increased work of the left ventricle was described in 1929. The term \u201ctypical strain\u201d was introduced in 1941 and referred to a specific ST-T abnormality, which was attributed to an increased hemodynamic burden. It consisted of J-point depression, upwardly convex down-sloping depression of the ST segment, and asymmetrical inversion of the T wave. It is now appreciated that electrocardiographic LVH with ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities occurs in conditions that are not necessarily caused by increased hemodynamic work, as in patients with dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, and that lesser degrees of ST-T abnormalities than the \u201ctypical strain\u201d pattern are associated with LVH. Thus, the terms \u201cstrain\u201d and \u201ctypical strain\u201d are discouraged, and the term \u201csecondary ST-T abnormalities\u201d is preferred. The presence of ST-T-wave abnormalities provides major support to a diagnosis of LVH that would otherwise be based only on increased QRS voltage, and there is evidence to suggest that the presence of ST-T abnormalities are associated with larger values for left ventricular mass and higher risks of cardiovascular complications and mortality than an increase in QRS voltage alone. However, the evidence is insufficient to indicate whether the \u201ctypical strain\u201d pattern has more significant clinical implications than lesser ST-T abnormalities, whether ST-T abnormalities should be used to diagnose LVH in the absence of any QRS voltage criteria, or whether the presence of ST-T abnormalities should allow modification of QRS voltage criteria. These are important issues for further investigation.\n\nLeft Atrial Abnormalities With LVH\n\nP-wave abnormalities that are known to be associated with left atrial dilatation, hypertrophy, conduction delay, or elevated pressure are frequently associated with LVH and have been used as diagnostic criteria. P-wave changes occur frequently in patients with hypertension, and they may be the earliest electrocardiographic sign of hypertensive heart disease. However, similar P-wave abnormalities often occur in the absence of LVH. For this reason, and because adequate clinical studies assessing the accuracy of this criterion, either alone or in combination with other criteria, have not been reported, P-wave abnormalities should only be used as a supporting criterion.\n\nLeft Axis Deviation With LVH\n\nLeft axis deviation may be associated with LVH. However, it is not known whether left axis deviation results from hypertrophy itself, a degree of left anterior fascicular block, or other factors that may underlie the tendency toward a more leftward axis with increasing age, even in the absence of LVH.\n\nProlonged QT Interval\n\nLVH is often associated with slight prolongation of the QT interval, but it is not known whether QT-interval prolongation has independent value as an electrocardiographic criterion for LVH or is simply secondary to prolongation of QRS duration. A slightly prolonged QT interval is consistent with but not diagnostic of LVH.

As both LVH and IVCDs alter QRS patterns, the existence of an IVCD may impact the accuracy of ECG criteria for LVH.\n\nLeft Anterior Fascicular Block\n\nIn left anterior fascicular block, the QRS vector shifts in a posterior and superior direction, resulting in larger R waves in leads I and aVL and smaller R waves but deeper S waves in leads V and V. R-wave amplitude in leads I and aVL are not reliable criteria for LVH in this situation. Criteria that include the depth of the S wave in left precordial leads improve detection of LVH in the presence of left anterior fascicular block.\n\nLeft Bundle-Branch Block\n\nStudies of the electrocardiographic diagnosis of LVH in the presence of complete left bundle-branch block (LBBB) have yielded conflicting results. Some have concluded that the diagnosis should not be attempted in this setting, whereas others believe that the diagnosis can be made. Estimations of specificity are affected by the relatively high prevalence of anatomic LVH in patients with LBBB, especially in autopsy series, where it may be 90% or more. The variable results may also reflect differing definitions of LBBB. Strict definitions, which require monophasic notched or plateau-topped R waves in leads I, aVL, V, and V, tend to show low sensitivity for LVH criteria. Broader definitions, which require only a QRS duration greater than 120 ms, slurred predominant R in left precordial leads, and slurred predominant S wave in the right precordial leads, probably include cases that could be classified as LVH with associated intraventricular conduction delay rather than LBBB. Because \u201ccomplete\u201d LBBB may often be not truly complete, and because the QRS duration in LVH can probably be greater than 120 ms without a localized lesion in the left bundle, the distinction between these two entities may be difficult to define.

The ancillary features of left atrial abnormality and left axis deviation have enhanced value for the diagnosis of LVH in the presence of RBBB. Several criteria have been proposed for use specifically in the presence of RBBB, including S V1 greater than 2 mm (0.2 mV), R V5,6 greater than 15 mm (1.5 mV), and QRS axis to the left of -30, with S III largest R/S in a precordial lead greater than 30 mm (3.0 mV). These criteria were reported to have sensitivities of 46% to 68% and specificities of 57% to 71%.\n\nIssues of Terminology\n\nEstimates of Probability\n\nQualifying diagnostic terms such as probable or possible or consider are subject to multiple interpretations and may be used to indicate that some criteria for LVH are met, but that the accuracy of these criteria is limited, or that the criteria almost meet the threshold values, but that LVH is still strongly considered because of other contravening variables, such as obesity. Each interpretation has different meanings to the reader and to the user of the ECG. Hence these terms should be used and interpreted with caution. Additional studies would be worthwhile to propose specific criteria for their use.\n\nDiagnostic Terms\n\nOver years of use, electrocardiographers have adopted various terms for certain ECG findings, many with limited usefulness and accuracy. The terms systolic (pressure) overload and diastolic (volume) overload have limited accuracy in patients with congenital heart disease and in adults, and their use is not recommended. As discussed above, the term strain originated in an older concept of an ST-T abnormality that was considered to reflect ventricular overwork but not necessarily hypertrophy.

As discussed above, the term strain originated in an older concept of an ST-T abnormality that was considered to reflect ventricular overwork but not necessarily hypertrophy. Its use should also be discontinued.\n\nSpecial Issues in Children\n\nElectrocardiographic detection of ventricular hypertrophy in children is largely based on QRS voltage abnormalities. The standards for QRS voltage are derived from studies of populations of clinically normal children. Studies are relatively few and do not always include referencing to body size, gender, or race. Correlation with echocardiograms is also limited, and reference standards from autopsy or magnetic resonance imaging are not available. Standards derived from a population of Canadian children are widely used in North America. More recent studies in Scottish children using a digital sampling rate of 500 samples per second and in Dutch children using a sampling rate of 1200 samples per second showed higher upper limits.\n\nOther Considerations\n\nSeveral other factors influence the value of the ECG in detecting LVH. The sensitivity and specificity of various ECG criteria reflect issues related to the types of heart disease, anatomic patterns of LVH, and degrees of hypertrophy present in different patient populations. Okin et al noted that in patients with mild or moderate hypertension, an increase in the product of the S V3-R aVL voltage and the QRS duration characterized older patients who were obese and female, whereas an increase in the sum of S V1 and R V5 was more characteristic of patients who were younger, male, black, and nonobese. The accuracy will also be different in populations in which LVH is unlikely (with most positive tests being false positives) than in populations in which LVH is more likely, for example, groups of patients with significant hypertension, in which more negative results will be false negatives. It is also important to recognize that the characteristics of patient groups in whom the criteria were established may be different from those in whom the criteria are applied.\n\nRecommendations\n\n1. Interpretation of ECGs for LVH should use only validated criteria, without deviation from the validated formulas.\n2. No single diagnostic criterion can be recommended for use compared with the others.\n3. Computer systems should use all criteria that are supported by valid evidence for identifying LVH.\n4. Interpretations should specify which diagnostic criteria were used and which were abnormal (and thereby, by exclusion, which were examined but not found to be abnormal).\n5. Criteria should be adjusted for factors known to alter accuracy, including gender, race, and body habitus, when such criteria have been validated.\n6. The terms strain, systolic, and diastolic should not be used in diagnostic statements related to LVH.\n7. The terms probable, possible, and borderline should be used with caution.\n8. Because the evidence is conflicting, the diagnosis of LVH in the presence of complete LBBB should be made with caution.\n\nRecommendations for Further Study\n\nIssues that require additional study before recommendations can be made include the following:\n\n1. Development and testing of adjustments of major diagnostic criteria for gender, race, age, and body habitus;\n---\n Right Ventricular Hypertrophy\n\nRight ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) causes a displacement of the QRS vector toward the right and anteriorly and often causes a delay in the R-wave peak in right precordial leads. However, considerable degrees of RVH are often required to change the balance of right and left ventricular vectors, because the vector of left ventricular activation dominates the balance in the normal heart and even more so in the setting of LVH. Thus, the ability of the ECG to detect RVH may be expected to be low.\n\nNumerous criteria mostly derived from the amplitude of R and S in leads I, V1, V6, and the R-wave peak time in V1 have been proposed and are shown in Table 2. They have been correlated primarily with autopsy data, although some are based on clinical and hemodynamic identification of conditions that impose increased workloads on the right ventricle. The echocardiogram has also been used as a reference standard, but it is less definitive than in LVH because of the complex 3-dimensional shape of the right ventricle and the frequent difficulty of measuring the thickness of the right ventricular free wall.", "start_char_idx": 7729, "end_char_idx": 12715, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40b67621-27c5-4089-bd63-1c7406d8c34b": {"__data__": {"id_": "40b67621-27c5-4089-bd63-1c7406d8c34b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 105000, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1efc066-1be5-4ae3-8239-d3c01b76dbfe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 105000, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "7f118ca6d24e02fdc0eb1c5012c875569b02e2a6e1c2cb10c9f1adb8a95424e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "78326717-4800-495b-a938-ded549f00cea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 105000, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "51c2e9077ecc81d1ee0f0549dafabee5e8395c8514f54fa3bf5f2d67843c4ff9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_e1efc066-1be5-4ae3-8239-d3c01b76dbfe_30_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "", "file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 105000, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "6dfdb6284c33d487d29e63fb4e0b4e014a2b06b84db2c1014a1991810514e4b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, considerable degrees of RVH are often required to change the balance of right and left ventricular vectors, because the vector of left ventricular activation dominates the balance in the normal heart and even more so in the setting of LVH.

The greatest accuracy is in congenital heart disease, with intermediate accuracy in acquired heart disease and primary pulmonary hypertension in adults. The lowest accuracy occurs in chronic lung disease.\n\nElectrocardiographic RVH, particularly in congenital heart disease, has often been classified on the basis of contrasting ECG patterns. One pattern is similar to that of incomplete RBBB, suggesting volume overload, and a second pattern consists of predominantly tall R waves (as part of Rs, R, or Qr complexes) in right precordial leads, suggesting pressure overload. Both patterns are associated with right axis deviation. Both are also frequently associated with ST depression and T-wave inversion in right precordial leads; as with LVH, these ST-T abnormalities are better referred to as \u201csecondary ST-T abnormality\u201d than as \u201cstrain.\u201d In patients with chronic nonobstructive lung disease, there is often right axis deviation and deep S waves in the precordial leads.\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease often causes a characteristic electrocardiographic pattern that reflects mainly the low diaphragm resulting from the increased lung volume. This pattern includes low voltage in the limb leads; a frontal plane QRS axis that is rightward, superior, or indeterminate; a rightward P-wave axis (ie, greater than 60 degrees); persistent S waves in all precordial leads; and low R-wave amplitude in V6. RVH is suggested, in the presence of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pattern, only if R-wave amplitude in V1 is relatively increased.\n\nRight axis deviation and prominent anterior forces in the right precordial leads should be required for the electrocardiographic diagnosis of RVH in nearly all cases. On the other hand, such features occur for various reasons other than RVH, including a not-infrequent normal variant. The use of ancillary clinical information, therefore, plays a greater role in the appropriate use of the ECG for the purpose of recognizing RVH than it does in the case of LVH or the atrial abnormalities.\n\n Table 2.

Amplitudes are given in millimeters, where 1 mm=0.1 mV.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. No single criterion or limited set of criteria can be recommended for use exclusive of other validated criteria. The effect of using larger numbers of criteria on sensitivity and specificity should be further studied.\n2. Criteria should be adjusted for age, gender, race, and body habitus.\n3. Probability estimates for RVH should be adjusted in the light of available clinical diagnoses suggesting congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, or chronic pulmonary disease. Incorporation of such clinical diagnoses into computer algorithms should be explored.\n\n Biventricular Hypertrophy\n\nHypertrophy of both the right and left ventricle is relatively common in patients with heart disease of many types. Its recognition by ECG has a particularly low sensitivity, explained at least in part by the cancellation of increased QRS vectors of both RVH and LVH. In the presence of ECG criteria for LVH, the presence of prominent S waves in V5 or V6, right axis deviation, unusually tall biphasic R/S complexes in several leads, and signs of right atrial abnormality are useful signs that RVH may also be present.\n\nIn patients with congenital heart defects and RVH, the presence of combined tall R waves and deep S waves in leads V2 to V4, with combined amplitude greater than 60 mm (6.0 mV), suggests the presence of LVH.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. Biventricular hypertrophy should be suggested on the basis of the presence of accepted criteria for both RVH and LVH. The low sensitivity of such patterns should be noted.\n2. Right axis deviation in the presence of electrocardiographic LVH and tall biphasic R/S complexes in several leads should be recognized as suggestive of biventricular hypertrophy.\n\n Atrial (P-Wave) Abnormalities\n\nAbnormalities in the P wave that are related to anatomic or physiological abnormalities in the right or left atrium have been recognized since the early years of electrocardiography. The terms P-mitrale, P-congenitale, and P-pulmonale were later replaced by left atrial enlargement and right atrial enlargement, as it was realized that different clinical conditions caused similar abnormalities. However, other terms such as atrial hypertrophy, atrial overload, atrial strain, and interatrial (or intraatrial) conduction defect have also been used, reflecting the fact that atrial dilatation, atrial muscular hypertrophy, elevated atrial pressure, impaired ventricular distensibility, and delayed intraatrial conduction all seem to play a role in causing P-wave abnormalities. Because the effects of these several factors on the P wave may often appear in combination and may not be distinguishable, the less specific terms left atrial abnormality and right atrial abnormality are preferable.\n\n Left Atrial Abnormality\n\nLeft atrial abnormality usually involves prolongation of the total atrial activation time, because left atrial activation begins and ends later than right atrial activation. Delay in the left atrial activation tends to cause a double-peaked or notched P wave, because the right and left atrial peaks that are normally nearly simultaneous and fused into a single peak become more widely separated. Activation of the left atrium has a more leftward and posterior vector than that of the right atrium. The product of the amplitude and the duration of the terminal negative component of the P wave in lead V1 (the P terminal force) has been used most frequently of the various criteria for left atrial abnormality, but the P-wave duration (120 ms or more) and widely notched P wave (40 ms or more) appear to have equal value. Several other criteria, including left axis of the terminal P wave (\u00b130 to \u00b190), and possibly the P-wave area, are also useful. A purely negative P wave in V1 is suggestive but can occur without an increased P terminal force.\n\nProlonged activation time of the atrium, indicated by the total duration of the P wave of 120 ms or more, is present in a large majority of patients with electrocardiographic signs that are considered to represent left atrial abnormalities. Conduction delay is more closely linked to left atrial abnormality than to right atrial abnormality, probably because it often represents delay in the specialized interatrial pathway (Bachmann\u2019s bundle) and possibly within the left atrial myocardium as well. The more general term intraatrial is therefore preferable to interatrial.\n\n Right Atrial Abnormality\n\nRight atrial abnormality is typically manifested as an increase in amplitude of the P wave and a tendency to rightward shift.", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4630, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39588f97-6648-41cf-bff3-e241bfd744e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "39588f97-6648-41cf-bff3-e241bfd744e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 105000, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1efc066-1be5-4ae3-8239-d3c01b76dbfe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 105000, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "7f118ca6d24e02fdc0eb1c5012c875569b02e2a6e1c2cb10c9f1adb8a95424e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "12d6b64c-b0bb-4d04-aa0a-0e88a5826c72", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 105000, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "4faddca329b5a772a940ec8ab5ab966fea2d7b8b52207875bbf34a52ff5d2510", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "id_e1efc066-1be5-4ae3-8239-d3c01b76dbfe_54_table_ref", "node_type": "3", "metadata": {"col_schema": "Column: Reviewer\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Employment\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Research Grant Support\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Speakers' Bureau/Honoraria\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Expert Witness\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Ownership Interest\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Consultant/Advisory Board\nType: text\nSummary: None\n\nColumn: Other\nType: text\nSummary: None", "file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part V.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 105000, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "f79b1cf507be2dce9bfab9b0cb355cce6321a56f13b18665653805922e319536", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A purely negative P wave in V1 is suggestive but can occur without an increased P terminal force.\n\nProlonged activation time of the atrium, indicated by the total duration of the P wave of 120 ms or more, is present in a large majority of patients with electrocardiographic signs that are considered to represent left atrial abnormalities.

A tall upright P wave in lead II (greater than 2.5 mm) is characteristic, often with a peaked or pointed appearance that presumably reflects summation of the enhanced right atrial component with the simultaneous left atrial component. Right atrial abnormality increases the amplitude of the initial P-wave forces, contrasting with increase in the later P-wave forces that can result from left atrial abnormality (pseudo-P pulmonale). Prominent initial positivity of the P wave in V 1 or V 2 (1.5 mm [0.15 mV] or more) also indicates right atrial abnormality. Rightward axis of the P wave and a peaked form without increased amplitude are supportive signs. Total P-wave duration is usually normal, but an exception occurs in patients with surgically repaired congenital heart disease (especially those with single ventricle physiology) where significant P-wave prolongation occurs and is a risk factor for the development of atrial tachyarrhythmias.\n\n Combined Atrial Abnormality\n\nCombined atrial abnormality is indicated essentially by the presence of some of the features of both right atrial and left atrial abnormality. However, little evidence is available regarding the accuracy of ECG criteria for combined atrial abnormality.\n\n Recommendations\n\n1.

The project was initiated by the Council on Clinical Cardiology of the American Heart Association (AHA). The rationale for the project and the process for its implementation were described in a previous publication. 1 The ECG is considered the single most important initial clinical test for diagnosing myocardial ischemia and infarction. Its correct interpretation, particularly in the emergency department, is usually the basis for immediate therapeutic interventions and/or subsequent diagnostic tests. The ECG changes that occur\n\nThe ST-segment changes are produced by the flow of currents, referred to as \u201cinjury currents,\u201d that are generated by the voltage gradients across the boundary between the ischemic and nonischemic myocardium during the resting and plateau phases of the ventricular action potential, which correspond to the TQ and ST segments of the ECG. 2,3 Current guidelines suggest that when these ST-segment shifts reach\n\nOther members of the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram Writing Group include James J.

The negative electrode for the 3 aV (or augmented) limb leads (aVR, aVL, and aVF) is provided by the averaged inputs from the 2 limb electrodes that do not serve as the positive electrode for a specified lead; for example, for aVR, the averaged potential of the left arm and left leg electrodes is used.\n\nA second principle is that the ST-segment elevation in any lead will usually be associated with reciprocal ST-segment depression in leads whose positive pole is directed opposite to (ie, approximately 180\u00b0 away from) the leads that show the ST-segment elevation and vice versa. If no body surface lead fulfills this condition, then only ST-segment elevation or depression will be displayed on the routine 12-lead ECG. In addition, reciprocal ST-segment change may be absent in leads in which it would be expected if the voltage transmitted to the body surface is inadequate to meet diagnostic criteria.\n\nThis might occur if, in addition to ischemia/infarction, there is associated left ventricular hypertrophy with ST- and T-wave changes, an intraventricular conduction disturbance with secondary ST- and T-wave changes, or pericarditis. For this reason, the injury currents associated with acute ischemia/infarction may cause ST-segment elevation, ST-segment depression, both, or neither in any body surface lead depending on the relationship between the location of the positive and negative poles that determine the spatial orientation of that lead, the location of the ischemic region, the magnitude of the voltage transmitted to the body surface, and the presence of confounding ECG abnormalities.\n\nWith the advent of automated recording systems and the performance of large-scale, multicenter clinical trials, a large experience has accumulated that permits the redefinition of normal ECG characteristics and the correlation of ischemia-induced ECG abnormalities to angiographic findings obtained in temporal proximity to the recording of the ECG. As a result, the standard 12-lead body-surface ECG is now capable of providing a more accurate correlation of the waveform changes to the involved vessel and to the site of occlusion within that vessel.", "start_char_idx": 3536, "end_char_idx": 8076, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da1f50b4-7280-46ef-ba0a-720d7ad1b239": {"__data__": {"id_": "da1f50b4-7280-46ef-ba0a-720d7ad1b239", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part VI.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part VI.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 89087, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d06d606-a889-49bb-874d-e833bae9e0db", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part VI.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part VI.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 89087, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "4ab8850584d3ba658702870c3b74b4918584a432c88ee79128cc9d5b1939d131", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f96f90cc-8644-4ae1-872d-4dbf350d621f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part VI.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part VI.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 89087, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "8f2363c8be7731b28f9c4dc9d61a4dd6ad3d2b30de462a9ca3639a71344efa86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e4aced9-4232-4345-affa-34f12799509d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part VI.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part VI.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 89087, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "06ce7a449b425254386e9afbe7ce7db8f572a9f458819f4311ecf10d3c8aef27", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "For this reason, the injury currents associated with acute ischemia/infarction may cause ST-segment elevation, ST-segment depression, both, or neither in any body surface lead depending on the relationship between the location of the positive and negative poles that determine the spatial orientation of that lead, the location of the ischemic region, the magnitude of the voltage transmitted to the body surface, and the presence of confounding ECG abnormalities.\n\nWith the advent of automated recording systems and the performance of large-scale, multicenter clinical trials, a large experience has accumulated that permits the redefinition of normal ECG characteristics and the correlation of ischemia-induced ECG abnormalities to angiographic findings obtained in temporal proximity to the recording of the ECG. As a result, the standard 12-lead body-surface ECG is now capable of providing a more accurate correlation of the waveform changes to the involved vessel and to the site of occlusion within that vessel. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging studies that correlate the ECG changes that result from ischemia/infarction to the extent and location of the involved myocardial region are beginning to appear and are expected to result in more anatomically valid nomenclature of the ischemic/infarcted region, particularly in what is now referred to as the posterior region of the left ventricle.\n\nThe purpose of this section of the standards document is to reexamine the existing ECG criteria for ischemia/infarction. Our recommendations are focused primarily on the changes in the ST segment that occur during the early acute phase of acute coronary syndromes; however, some of the T-wave changes in the postreperfusion phase and the QRS changes in the chronic phase are also considered. The following topics are discussed: (1) The meaning and importance of both ST-segment elevation and depression; (2) the concept of anatomically contiguous leads; (3) the threshold values for ST-segment changes; (4) the use of the ST-segment spatial vector to determine the region involved and the occluded coronary artery; (5) the importance of postischemic T-wave changes; (6) the diagnosis of ischemia/infarction in the presence of intraventricular conduction disturbances; and (7) quantitative QRS changes for estimation of chronic infarct size.\n\nMeaning and Importance of ST-Segment Elevation and Depression\n\nAn understanding of the relationship between ST-segment elevation and depression requires consideration of certain bioelectric principles. One of these is that all leads are bipolar. However, only 3 leads (leads I, II, and III) use 2 dedicated electrodes, 1 connected to the positive input of the ECG machine and the other to the negative input. The remaining 9 leads use only 1 dedicated positive electrode.\n\nThe changes in the QRS complex reflect changes in electrical activation within the severely ischemic or infarcted region. The magnitude and extent of these ECG changes depend on the size and location of the ischemic/infarcted region and the relationship of this region to the spatial orientation of the particular ECG lead. The size and location of the affected region depend, in turn, on the coronary artery involved, the site of occlusion within the artery, and the presence or absence of collateral circulation.\n\nFor instance, ST-segment depression in a lead with its positive pole to the left and superiorly placed, such as lead aVL, is the reciprocal of and similar in meaning to ST-segment elevation in a lead with its positive pole located to the right and inferiorly placed, such as lead III. Conversely, ST-segment depression in lead III is the reciprocal of and similar in meaning to ST-segment elevation in lead aVL. In the same way, ST-segment depression in leads V 1 and V 2, in which the positive pole is located anteriorly, is the reciprocal of and similar in meaning to the ST-segment elevation that would be recorded if the positive electrode were placed on the posterior chest wall, as in the V 8 and V 9 positions.\n\nIt is important to recognize that the magnitude of ST-segment elevation and reciprocal ST-segment depression (or vice versa) may not be identical because of differences in the distance of the leads recording these changes from the ischemic region and the deviation of the leads from being 180\u00b0 opposite to each other. This is particularly relevant to the ST-segment changes that occur in lead aVL, because this lead frequently has a spatial orientation that is approximately perpendicular to the mean QRS vector.\n\nIt is also important to stress that factors other than acute ischemia may cause elevation or depression of the ST segment.

Criteria have been published to differentiate these abnormalities in the ST segment from those associated with acute ischemia. 7 Acute ischemia that typically results from coronary artery occlusion is associated with ST-segment elevation in leads whose positive poles are located over the ischemic region and with reciprocal ST depression in leads whose positive poles are oriented in the opposite direction. It is anatomically reasonable but conceptually limiting to refer to leads as anterior, inferior, or lateral, because this nomenclature refers only to the location on the body surface of the electrode that determines the positive pole of that lead. These lead descriptions, although frequently used, may mislead clinicians to consider that all ST-segment abnormalities in a particular lead, for example, an anterior lead such as V or V, are located in that anatomic region and could not be the reciprocal of ischemic ST-segment changes occurring in the opposite anatomic region. Indeed, depression of the ST segment in leads V 1 and V 2 is a common manifestation of a posterior or lateral ST-segment elevation infarction. Note that the concept of subendocardial ischemia causing depression of the ST segment in multiple leads is still tenable and, as discussed below, may be thought of as the reciprocal of endocardial ST-segment elevation caused by currents of injury directed toward the ventricular chamber. Recommendation 1. Labeling specific leads as anterior, inferior, and lateral should be avoided. Leads should be identified according to their original nomenclature, that is, leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and V 1 through V 6. This recommendation refers only to the labeling of the leads. Reference to the anatomic location of the ischemic/infarcted region, such as anterior or inferior, is still recommended and is based on the leads that show the ST-segment alterations. This is discussed below. Concept of Anatomically Contiguous Leads The current ECG standards for diagnosing acute ischemia/ infarction require that ST-segment elevation be present in 2 or more contiguous leads and that the elevation of the ST segment at the J point be greater than 0.2 mV (2 mm with standard calibration) in leads V 1, V 2, and V 3 and greater than 0.1 mV in all other leads. 4 In the classic ECG display, the chest leads V 1 through V 6 are displayed on the ECG paper in their anatomically contiguous order from right anterior (V 1) to left lateral (V 6); however, the limb leads are not. Rather, they are displayed in 2 groups of 3: leads I, II, and III and leads aVR, aVL, and aVF, which reflects their historical development. For these leads to be displayed in their anatomically contiguous manner, that is, from left superior-basal to right inferior, the display should be aVL, I, aVR (ie, lead aVR with reversed polarity), II, aVF, and III. With this configuration, aVR exists at 30\u00b0 in the hexaxial frontal plane, ie, midway between limb lead I (at 0\u00b0) and limb lead II (at 60\u00b0).

ECG manufacturers are encouraged to develop software capable of displaying the spatial orientation of the ST-segment vector in both the frontal and transverse planes.\n2. Wherever possible, the ECG diagnosis provided by automated algorithms should refer to the occluded vessel and to the site of the occlusion within that vessel, as well as to the region involved.\n3. When ST-segment elevation is present in I and aVL, as well as in leads V 1 through V 4 and sometimes in V 6, and ST-segment depression is present in leads II, III, and aVF, the automated interpretation should suggest an extensive anterior wall or anterobasal ischemia/infarction due to occlusion of the proximal portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery.\n\n1. When ST-segment elevation is present in leads V 3 through V 6, and ST-segment depression is not present in leads II, III, and aVF, the automated interpretation should suggest anterior wall ischemia/infarction due to occlusion of the mid or distal portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery.\n\n2. Inferior wall infarction that results in ST-segment elevation in only leads II, III, and aVF may be the result of occlusion of either the right coronary artery (RCA) or the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx), depending on which provides the posterior descending branch, that is, which is the dominant vessel.\n\n3. ECG machines should be programmed to suggest the recording of the right-sided chest leads V 3R and V 4R when ST elevation greater than 0.1 mV occurs in leads II, III, and aVF.\n\n4. ECG machines should be equipped with a mechanism to label leads V 3R and V 4R.\n\n5. Descriptive and interpretative statements should be developed to describe and interpret abnormalities that might occur in leads V R and V R.\n\n6. ST-segment depression in leads V 1, V 2, and V 3 that occurs in association with an inferior wall infarction may be caused by occlusion of either the RCA or the LCx. This ECG pattern has been termed posterior or posterolateral ischemia since the recommendations of Perloff and Horan et al and is based on anatomic and pathological studies of ex vivo hearts.\n\n7. The joint task force of the AHA and the American College of Cardiology, in collaboration with the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, has recommended that right-sided chest leads V 3R and V 4R be recorded in all patients presenting with ECG evidence of acute inferior wall ischemia/infarction.\n\n8.

Automated ECG algorithms should suggest the possibility of acute ischemia/infarction in patients with left bundle-branch block who have ST-segment changes that meet the above criteria.\n\n Quantitative QRS Changes for Estimation of Infarct Size\n\nOne method for determining the presence of a remote myocardial infarct has been the Minnesota Code. This method was developed for the diagnosis of infarction rather than the quantification of its size and correlates poorly with anatomically measured infarct size. An improved correlation of changes in the QRS complex with infarct size was the development of a QRS scoring system by Selvester et al using a computer model of the human myocardial activation sequence reported by Durrer et al. The Selvester QRS scoring system included 54 weighted criteria from the QRS complexes in 10 of the standard leads (leads I, II, aVL, aVF, and V1 through V6), which totaled 32 QRS points, each equivalent to approximately 3% of the left ventricular wall. The specificity of the Selvester method has been established in normal subjects, and its ability to detect and estimate the anatomically determined sizes of prior infarctions has been documented. However, these estimates are most useful in the setting of a single infarct.\n\n Recommendation\n\n1. Algorithms capable of determining the Selvester score in tracings that meet the criteria for prior infarctions should be developed and available for use by the reader if so desired.\n---", "start_char_idx": 26130, "end_char_idx": 28708, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72be7a36-73a0-45ad-9dac-b3313a0eef20": {"__data__": {"id_": "72be7a36-73a0-45ad-9dac-b3313a0eef20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part VI.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part VI.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 89087, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d06d606-a889-49bb-874d-e833bae9e0db", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part VI.pdf", "file_name": "Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram - Part VI.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 89087, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "4ab8850584d3ba658702870c3b74b4918584a432c88ee79128cc9d5b1939d131", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "id_5d06d606-a889-49bb-874d-e833bae9e0db_16_table", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"table_df": "{'Writing Group Member': {0: 'James J.

It is estimated that more than 52 million ECGs were analyzed by computer in the United States in 1987. A conservative estimate of the increase of computerized ECGs in the United States from 1987 until 2013 would indicate that 60 million computerized ECGs are taken presently in the United States. The cost of an ECG is $16.46 based on Medicare reimbursement, of which $8.30 is for the facility fee and $8.16 for the professional fee for interpretation. Based on these figures, the total yearly cost for computerized ECGs in the United States is over 2 billion dollars. It is the purpose of this report to indicate the appropriate standards for electrocardiographic recording and interpretation and to ensure that patients and taxpayers are obtaining the quality deserving of this large expenditure of funds.\n\n STANDARDS FOR ECG DEVICES\n\nThe approved standards for ECG recording devices are beyond the scope of this review. A generally accepted\n\nFunding: None.\n\nConflict of Interest: None.\n\nAuthorship: Frank Marcus, MD came with the unique idea of this article. Muhammad Ajmal, MD wrote the draft under kind guidance of Dr. Marcus. Dr. Marcus edited and finalized the final manuscript.\n\nRequests for reprints should be addressed to Dr. Muhammad Ajmal, University of Arizona, 1625 N Campbell Ave, Tucson, AZ 85719\n\nE-mail address: drajmal207@gmail.com\n---\n TaggedEndAjmal and Marcus Standardization in Performing and Interpreting Electrocardiograms\n\nThis also decreases the sensitivity to diagnose left ventricular hypertrophy and decreases or eliminates pacemaker spikes. 5 It also can change the duration of the Q wave as well as the intrinsicoid deflection (QRS onset to R-wave peak). Electrocardiograms that are electronically sent to an ECG management system may be recorded at full diagnostic bandwidth even if they are printed with a 40 Hz cutoff; therefore, they can be viewed with a 150 Hz filter if desired.\n\n SKIN PREPARATION TO IMPROVE ECG QUALITY\n\nSkin preparation by cleaning and gentle abrasion before electrode application can reduce motion artifact and improve the quality of the EKG. 7 The most used electrodes are impregnated with hydrogel, a solid gel preparation. Electrodes containing a wet gel consisting of 3%-10% salt concentration are also utilized. The quality of the ECG recording is generally improved by decreasing electrical skin impedance, which is primarily due to the outer layer of the skin, the stratum corneum. Mild rubbing of the skin with alcohol can remove the sweat or oil from the skin surface but may not eliminate artifact.

If the anterior axillary line is ambiguous, V5 should be placed midway between V4 and V6.\n---\n FEEDBACK TO ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHER FROM INTERPRETING PHYSICIANS\n\nProduction of good quality ECGs is best achieved by immediate feedback to the technician from the physicians who interpret the tracings. Each technician should write his or her identification number on each record, and a numerical grade of the ECG quality (1 excellent - 5 unacceptable) should be inserted by the interpreting physician. The reversal of limb leads and the switching of precordial leads have been well documented as causing alterations in the electrocardiogram that can change the diagnosis. Before being allowed to record routine ECGs, technicians should submit 5 to 10 tracings recorded by them to be certified by the electrocardiographer.\n\n TRAINING FOR ECG INTERPRETATION\n\nQualifications for the physician who interprets ECGs have never been defined nor are tests available from the American College of Cardiology or the Institute for Clinical Evaluation to assess whether the physician is correctly interpreting EKGs. Clinical competence in interpreting 12 ECGs was a subject of a report published in Circulation. This was a statement of medical competence by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA). It states, \"An adequate knowledge base should include the ability to define, recognize, and understand the basic physiology and certain ECG abnormalities 12. This is a modification of the list used in the ECG self-assessment program that is no longer available. (ECG-SAT III ABIM ICE ECG examination.) ECG readers Table 1 Proposed Recommendations for Electrocardiographers, Interpreters, and Hospitals\n\n ECG INTERPRETATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING\n\nA competent electrocardiographer should be quickly available in the emergency room to compare ECGs with previous ones. Interpretation of electrocardiograms by emergency room physicians pose a distinct problem in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. When the ECG is interpreted by the emergency room physician as an acute myocardial infarction, the cardiac invasive cardiology team must immediately come to the hospital to perform cardiac catheterization and treatment if necessary. In 2009, at a university hospital, there were 62 calls from the emergency room physicians to the invasive cardiology team, mostly based on an ECG interpreted as showing ST-elevation consistent with acute myocardial infarction. Of these, 26 (42%) were inappropriate (personal communication, Dr. K Kern).

There are also no standards to assess whether a technician can determine if the ECG is prop- erly recorded. Electrocardiograms are supposed to be sent electronically on the same day to the ECG labora- tory for interpretation by a cardiologist. However, sev- eral weeks of ECGs may be accumulated without being forwarded for interpretation.TaggedEnd\n\nTaggedH1UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL EXPERIENCETAGGEDEND TaggedPRecently, the quality of routine ECGs taken in the inpatient units at a university hospital was assessed by one cardiolo- gist. The assessment was made in three categories: TaggedEndTaggedP1. Excellent with minimal baseline artifactsTaggedEnd TaggedP2. Acceptable with moderate baseline artifactTaggedEnd TaggedP3. Severe baseline artifact or not interpretableTaggedEnd TaggedPThe results were as follows: 5% were excellent, 45% had moderate artifact, and 50% had severe artifact or were not interpretable. In contrast, one study found that when there was comprehensive training of technicians to enhance their skills for appropriate electrode application and artifact rec- ognition, 72% of the ECGs were graded as excellent, 25% were graded as moderate, and 2.4% had severe artifact. Electrocardiograms are recorded at several outpatient clin- ics that are university-based and are initially interpreted by the requesting physician who may not have adequate train- ing to interpret them.TaggedEnd\n\nTaggedH1CONCLUSIONTAGGEDEND TaggedPThe appropriate recording and processing of ECGs requires that the technician receive formal education in the technical aspects of obtaining ECGs; however, no formal training is available. The ECG interpreter (the physician) should have to be certified in cardiology or have to pass an examination that includes ECGs representing a wide variety of abnor- malities, but this requirement does not currently exist.

Many electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained in routine daily practice present inadequate lead placement. Heden et al., using automated ECG analysis software, showed that 2% of more than 11,000 ECGs analyzed presented lead placement interchange. To these errors, others must surely be added\u2014those frequently presenting due to high precordial lead displacement and, less frequently, those produced when limb leads are placed on the chest.\n\nThe presence of artifacts in ECG recordings may induce important diagnostic errors leading to unnecessary therapeutic interventions, such as antiarrhythmic treatment or the implantation of pacemakers or defibrillators. In this respect, Knight et al. showed that 38% of nearly 500 electrophysiologists participating in their study diagnosed as ventricular tachycardia what was in fact an artifact.

The reciprocal changes in inferior leads due to coronary descending artery occlusion are further accentuated on displacement of the limb electrodes to the torso.\n\nLead electrodes on the chest according to the Mason-Likar system 5 causes a rightward shift of the QRS axis, thus diminishing R voltage in lead I and aVL and increasing it in leads II, III, and aVF (Fig. 1).   6\u20138  Long ago, Einthoven obtained his first recordings using distal limbs submerged in buckets. Later authors 9\u201310 recommended placing electrodes on arms and legs far from the shoulders and hips, but not necessarily on the wrists and ankles.\n\nThe introduction of single-use adhesive electrodes, easily applied to any part of the limbs or even the chest, has significantly reduced ECG artifacts caused by movement and allowed more proximal limb lead placement. 11 Although advantageous in terms of speed and easy application, 12 the use of such electrodes with upward displacement provides ECGs that cannot be considered equivalent to standard ECGs.

However, there are well-defined patterns resulting from incorrect lead placement, regardless of the basal ECG. For example, tracings with a practically isoelectric line in leads I, II, or III are due to misplacement of the ground lead 13\u201314 to an upper limb (Fig. 2B).\n\nContralateral Interchange\n\nInterchange between Right and Left Arm Electrodes. This combination is one of the easiest errors to identify in routine clinical practice ECGs. Generally, the usual lead I tracing is inverted in sinus rhythm and P, QRS, and T are negative. Lead II is in fact lead III, and aVR is aVL and vice versa. With the left leg electrode correctly placed, aVF remains unaltered. The negative P wave recorded in lead I and positive in aVR, as can be observed in ectopic rhythms, is exceptional during sinus rhythm.

(D) Electrocardiogram of the same patient with correctly placed electrodes.\n\nInterchange between Left Arm and Left Leg Electrodes. Although changes are produced in all frontal plane leads except aVR, this placement error is difficult to detect. In general, the electrical axis of the P wave is more leftward than normal (30\u201370                       \u25e6 in 90% of normal cases)         18  with a larger P wave in lead I than in lead II, while in lead III we occasionally observe a biphasic (\u2212/+) P wave such as one that can be recorded in ectopic rhythms                   19  (Fig. 4). Heden proposed an automated system that can detect interchange between left arm and left leg electrodes with a sensitivity of 57% and specificity of practically 100%.      2 In the presence of atrial flutter, this error is easily detected by the characteristic sawtooth morphology recorded in lead III and aVF but not in lead II.   19  If this error occurs in an acute coronary syndrome patient with ST elevation in the inferior leads due to right coronary artery occlusion, the ECG shows ST elevation in lead I and aVL and ST depression in lead III and aVF, which in principle indicates that the defective artery is not the right coronary.     20  The same occurs in chronic phase inferior myocardial infarction with Q waves in lead II, III, and aVF where this interchange \u201cdisplaces\u201d the necrosis toward lead I and aVL.                  21\n\nCross-Over Electrode Interchange Interchange between Right Arm and Left Leg Electrodes.

(D) Tracing of the same patient with clockwise electrode rotation without ground electrode displacement, showing negative QS and P wave complexes similar to those obtained with right arm-left leg electrode interchange obtained in a patient without previous inferior infarction.\n\nInterchange between Left Arm and Right Leg Electrodes. The most striking aspect in this case is the presence of a practically isoelectric line in lead III due to practically no difference in potential between the right leg electrode (negative pole) and the incorrectly placed left leg electrode (positive pole). In this case, leads I and II are identical. This type of error also affects the potential of the precordial leads.\n\nClockwise and Anticlockwise Interchange without Misplacement of the Ground Lead. Ho and Ho described these two unusual ECG patterns resulting from the misplacement of three electrodes. Clockwise rotation generates a pattern similar to that obtained from interchanging right arm and left leg leads, with negative P waves and QRS complexes in inferior leads. Anticlockwise rotation generates a P axis with a marked right shift, with P positive in aVR and negative in lead II. Lead I and aVL are replaced by\u2014II and aVR, respectively.\n\nINCORRECT PLACEMENT OF PRECORDIAL LEADS. The misplacement of precordial lead electrodes is perhaps the most frequent error found when 12-lead ECGs are performed. The degree of inexactitude in the placement of precordial electrodes is closely related with the level of technical training of the professional performing the technique. This technical error may be due to (1) Vertical displacement of electrodes, usually toward the head. (2) Horizontal displacement of electrodes. (3) Interchange of electrodes with respect to their assigned places. The first and second cases are more difficult to detect than the third where abnormal R wave progression reveals the technical error.\n\nVertical Displacement of Electrodes. The method of correct placement of the precordial leads was described long ago and has recently been updated. The precise identification of the intercostal spaces (IS) is necessary for such placement. Of vital importance is the localization of the Sternal Angle or Angle of Louis to identify the 2nd IS and thereafter the 3rd and 4th IS. On occasions, there may be difficulty in locating the anatomical reference points, for example in obese individuals without a prominent sternal\n---\n1542474x, 2009, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1542-474X.2009.00328.x by Tshwane University Of Technology, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

In this case, the high placement of V           1 results in recording of the third vector due to basal ventricular depolarization (r\u2019 \u00b4o R\u2019).\n\nThe    V  4\u2013V  6   electrodes      are   sometimes         placed lower and too far to the left than their correct position, 30 and furthermore, V          5and V    6 are erroneously placed attempting to follow the costal curvature of the 5th IS. This is probably due to the fact that many ECG textbooks mention this anatomical reference point instead of the correct one, which is the same horizontal level as V          4 at the intersection of the anterior and midaxillary line.           16 New guidelines for the standardization and interpretation of ECGs recommend placing V          5 on the midline between V            4\u2013V  6 when the anterior axillary line is not well defined.                 1 However, V       1 and V    2 recordings with high IS electrode placement may be useful for increasing sensitivity to detect Brugada syndrome.               36,37\n\nIn women, V       1 and V   2 electrode placement is usually not affected by the breast size, whereas the placement of the other precordial leads, especially V 4 may be complicated by large breasts. Much debate has centered on the possible voltage attenuation of the ECG waves by placing electrodes on the left breast. Colaco       38 compared R wave amplitude with electrodes placed on the breast or below it. He showed significantly reduced V                 3  voltage with breast placement, but no significant differences for V 4 . However, V       5 and V    6 voltage was greater with electrodes placed on the left breast compared with placement below it.\n\nRautaharju et al.        39  reported that the effect of breast placement on ECG wave amplitude was insignificant and therefore recommended breast placement of precordial lead electrodes to facilitate more precise positioning. However, current\n\nFigure 6.     (A) From the sternal notch, the 2nd and 3rd fingers are slid down the sternum to the angle of Louis.

A typical error when trying to locate the 1st IS is to confuse it with the costoclavicular space. Another frequent error is high IS placement of V                  1 and V   2.30,31 This produces important ECG changes, especially in the P, R, and T waves.             32  Zema et al.    33 showed 1 mm reduction of the R wave for every IS involved.

Confusing an artifact with an important diagnostic entity may lead to inappropriate clinical intervention. Serious error may occur when an artifact results in diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia, for example, and unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for the patient. In this case, the artifact may easily be identified if any of the 12 leads presents basal rhythm of the patient. In other cases, it is necessary to perform a detailed examination of the basal complexes underlying the artifactual tracing appearing as a spike (R wave) or a notch (Fig. 10A). For this, a useful procedure is to identify the basal rhythm with a pair of compasses.\n\nIt is important to know that certain artifacts may sometimes simulate atrial waves. These artifacts may be produced by diaphragmatic contractions (singultus or hiccups) and also recording problems arising from involuntary patient movement such as tremor (Parkinson\u2019s disease). In the latter case, the artifact is usually more evident in the frontal plane leads, and the basal rhythm of the patient may be present in the precordial leads (Fig. 10B). The problem may disappear on placing the limb electrodes as proximal as possible, bearing in mind the need to record the modifications made in electrode placement. Davidenko and Snyder showed that on numerous occasions baseline artifacts lead to misdiagnosis of atrial fibrillation by medical staff, especially when there was irregular ventricular rhythm and low P wave amplitude.\n\nIMPROPER FILTER APPLICATION\n\nImproper filter application is relatively frequent in ECGs performed in daily clinical practice, as shown by Kligfield and Okin. In the great majority of the ECGs they studied, filters were applied that did not conform to the standards established by AHA in 1975.

Modern ECG recorders incorporate a notch filter that selectively attenuates the frequency of the interference produced by the electrical power line with a very narrow range of frequency so as not to significantly affect cardiac signals.         55 This filter cannot normally be deactivated from the keyboard, although some recorders allow this.\n\n(2)   Low-frequency high-pass filter.

This type of filter presents two important features: (1) They double the filtering order (while only doubling the filtering computational cost instead of multiplying it by a factor of four) and (2) they do not produce signal delay, which may be prolonged when dealing with high-order linear filters. Biderectional filters require storage of the signal in the computer memory for reverse-time filtering. From a practical point of view, this means that reverse-time filtering cannot be carried out when performing the ECG in real time (manual mode)    54  Alternative linear methods can be applied in real time, although there may be some signal delay.\n\n1.   High-frequency low-pass filters.\n\nHigh-frequency filters should be at least 150 Hz for adolescents and adults and up to 250 Hz for children.    1  It must be remembered that a high-frequency filter set too low, at 40 Hz for instance, eliminates most of the noise but also eliminates high-frequency signals that may be important from a clinical point of view (Fig. 11C) for example pacemaker peaks, R wave voltage, QRS notches, etc. 61\n\nFigure 11.      (A) Examples of artifacts caused by different circumstances. (B) Effect on the ST segment on manually applying three different low-frequency filters to precordial lead signals, in a healthy patient with early repolarization. A striking elevation of the ST segment is observed in V    1  and V  2  on applying the 0.5 Hz filter, but not when the standard recommended filter (0.05 Hz) is applied. (C) Lead V      5 in a healthy 23-year-old man with early repolarization. The J wave is visible on applying the low-pass filter at 150 Hz (arrow), but this disappears on reducing the frequency to 40 Hz.\n\nALTERNATIVES TO STANDARD ECG RECORDING\n\nThe different problems arising from incorrect electrode placement described above are directly related to the fact that standard 12-lead electrocardiography requires the correct placement of 10 electrodes. This number of electrodes may constitute a source of error. Much debate has therefore centered on the idea of developing more simplified recording systems.\n\nIn certain clinical settings, alternative ECG recording with simplified electrode placement is performed. Although any change in standard electrode positioning causes ECG wave alterations, this has little effect in continuous cardiac monitoring where the objective is to detect gross alterations in cardiac rhythm. Precisely in this setting, different more simplified systems of electrode placement\n---\n1542474x, 2009, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1542-474X.2009.00328.x by Tshwane University Of Technology, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

Mason-Likar system.\nIn 1966, Mason and Likar introduced a modification of standard electrode placement to overcome signal distortion due to muscle activation in exercise ECG, placing standard limb electrodes on the torso. The right arm electrode in the Mason-Likar modification is assigned to a point in the infraclavicular fossa medial to the border of the deltoid muscle. The left arm electrode is located similarly on the left side. The left leg electrode is placed on the anterior axillary line half way between the costal ridge and the left iliac crest (this position is not critical) and finally, the right leg electrode is habitually placed in the region of the right iliac fossa but can be placed elsewhere.\n\nThe rapid and easy applicability of this modification together with elimination of artifacts caused by limb movement has promoted its use in resting ECG recording. However, significant variations are observed between standard and the Mason-Likar ECG, as mentioned previously. The Wilson Central Terminal is notably affected, with reduced R wave amplitude in precordial leads and right shift of the axis in the frontal plane (Fig. 1).\n\nAlthough the Mason-Likar electrode positions have been suggested for use in routine 12-lead ECG, an appropriate system for converting recording data obtained from standard positioning to the alternative is necessary, primarily for the limb lead measurements or, although more complicated, the creation of new diagnostic standards adapted to this system.\n2. EASI system.\nDower et al. introduced a simplified configuration with four electrodes being placed on the patient torso (and one ground electrode, usually placed anywhere below these positions). Called EASI, this system places electrodes on E (sternum at the level of 5th intercostal space), A (midaxillary line at the level of V6), S (sternum below the sternal notch) and I (midaxillary line at the level of V6R). From these four electrodes, three essentially orthogonal leads are recorded and from them a full 12-lead ECG is derived. This system has been the subject of many studies seeking to determine its comparability with standard ECG in different clinical settings, such as the diagnosis of multiple cardiac abnormalities and the classification of acute myocardial ischemia and old myocardial infarction, where the tracings obtained with EASI were comparable to those obtained with the standard ECG system.\n\nMore recently, various studies have been published on the EASI system used to monitor high-risk coronary unit patients and to detect acute coronary syndrome in hospitalized patients. Sejersten et al. compared the management of patients referred to hospital with chest pain who had undergone three types of ECG before hospitalization (Standard ECG, EASI, and Mason-Likar electrode configuration). They sought possible differences in clinical decisions based on the ECGs obtained. Although acknowledging the obvious limitation of a small sample size, the authors recommended using either alternative system for patient monitoring but emphatically not for diagnostic purposes.\n\nTwo important aspects must be considered when using alternative systems.\n\n1. It is not possible to compare series ECGs obtained using different systems. This has basic clinical implications, the same patient may have ECG recordings performed at different stages (prehospital setting, emergency department, coronary unit, hospital ward, etc.). Clearly, comparisons between ECGs obtained by different systems may lead to erroneous diagnosis and inappropriate decisions.\n2. Any of the systems proposed as simplified alternatives to the conventional 12-lead ECG must consistently demonstrate accuracy and reliability in the clinical context, especially if our aim is to generalize their use as a routine technique.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nUndoubtedly, many factors and technical problems may alter the interpretation of ECGs. They may induce erroneous diagnoses and inappropriate therapeutic interventions, putting patients at risk, and harming the credibility of the medical\n---\n1542474x, 2009, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1542-474X.2009.00328.x by Tshwane University Of Technology, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].", "start_char_idx": 33684, "end_char_idx": 38501, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "116dddd7-b6fb-4a31-aecd-4b09a54813c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "116dddd7-b6fb-4a31-aecd-4b09a54813c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Technical Mistakes during the Acquisition of the Electrocardiogram.pdf", "file_name": "Technical Mistakes during the Acquisition of the Electrocardiogram.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1006334, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11992936-bee1-43c0-9c73-a536531296c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Technical Mistakes during the Acquisition of the Electrocardiogram.pdf", "file_name": "Technical Mistakes during the Acquisition of the Electrocardiogram.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1006334, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "a727bee6b20b9e0fafc2063b2b79110f2056c6a1035be1dd3fc953ba6de4ed81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6124d656-6f8d-4be0-a983-e841e724aab6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Technical Mistakes during the Acquisition of the Electrocardiogram.pdf", "file_name": "Technical Mistakes during the Acquisition of the Electrocardiogram.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1006334, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "fdf4c97e0e3240fe313fcacd1e3453cb5be2fa34748fca89a933231cd3b9d942", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "23660e6a-d572-4c04-970b-bbab35cde031", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/content/data/Technical Mistakes during the Acquisition of the Electrocardiogram.pdf", "file_name": "Technical Mistakes during the Acquisition of the Electrocardiogram.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1006334, "creation_date": "2024-04-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-14"}, "hash": "fc8c60a08099669cdb65051db1ba6668a7decda5ab0510341a4f13824686c0ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Clearly, comparisons between ECGs obtained by different systems may lead to erroneous diagnosis and inappropriate decisions.\n2.

All leads are effectively \u201cbipolar,\u201d and the term \u201cunipolar\u201d in description of the augmented limb leads and the precordial leads lacks precision. Reference is made to the comprehensive study of lead systems for various types of electrocardiography by Macfarlane. Skin preparation by cleaning and gentle abrasion before electrode application can reduce noise and improve the quality of the recorded ECG. Historically, limb lead electrodes have been attached at the wrists and the ankles, with the patient in the supine position, generally with a pillow under the head. For routine 12-lead recording, the AHA statement of 1975 recommended placement of the 4 limb lead electrodes on the arms and legs distal to the shoulders and hips, and thus not necessarily on the wrists and ankles. Evidence exists that different placement of electrodes on the limbs can alter the ECG, a phenomenon that appears to be more marked with respect to the left arm electrode. Therefore, reevaluation of the magnitude of changes due to variation in limb electrode placement in clinical practice is required, as discussed below.
